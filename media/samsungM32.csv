5,yashu,Joke.. never buy. 7k features in 20k price. Lol,1.0,6,9,2021,1,186,"I sold the phone sameday somehow on olx in 4k loss. Amazon doesn‚Äôt provide return.Phone is a joke.Plain M32 had full hd screen and now with 5G price has gone up by 6k and display is surprisingly half hd(HD+) . This is plain loot.Plastic is cheap.Camera is worst than any 10k phnSlow processorEven screen lags in scrolling, such bad refresh ratePathetic Processor and ramOverall its from 2012 times where HD+ was a thing. This phone is 9 yrs late.Never buy samsung in this segment."

Galaxy M30s is better when compared to M32 5G, M30s has good battery capacity and camera quality,2. The camera quality is poor and the pixels.3. In this phone we can expect only 5G option that too we have to check after upgrading the sim.4. Regarding softwares I will post after updating the new software installation from Samsung,"

14,prabu,Over heat is produced while charging and while using the phone,2.0,8,9,2021,1,45,Over heat is produced while charging and when wattsapp messages receive and downloading. Spoke to customer care executive but they are not ready to take return

16,Ganesh,Worst mobile with high price and wrost response by amazon team,1.0,28,9,2021,1,41,"The quality of camera, screen and performance or not at all good.camera quality is very very poor not even capturing photo like a phone of cost 3k. And the return policy of amazon was worst. Not a proper response by the executives of amazon. They are not accepting the return of this product, don't know the reason behind this. Dont  Why they are enecouranging sale of this product,  when they are getting similar problem form multiple customers.  Belief on amazon have worsening day by day.. literally disopinted with the amazon."
17,Amazon Customer,Sumsung lunch another wort Mobile,1.0,14,9,2021,1,41,"It's a worst mobile phone ever, Samsung proof that they are loos their credibility in India. This phone can not be worth more than  8k to 10 k. Camera is very poor, You can only use single Sim if you are using Micro SD card, Display is very poor , plz don't buy this phone. I think Samsung is going footprint of NOKIA ."
18,Priyank Joglekar,Best phone in price range,5.0,4,9,2021,1,35,"Smooth touch, future ready with 5g, sleek design, expandable memory option upto 1 tb.First impression of the phone is good,when used phone continuously for over 2 hrs, videos and downloads and battery went from 50% to 25%, so i expect it to run for a day with full charge. Fast charge is also excellent, but not like other fast charges available in market. Its 1 min for 1% approxThere has been a issue with the M series of phones with UI not responding and system hangs, but this processor on m32 seems to be strong and they have I reckon resolved the issue (recommended not to use Samsung in build apps much as they consume lot of data and there is unnecessary lots of cashed data stored).Camera is OK, but they have lot of features like macro cam for close up night mode and have snap chat filters pre-added on camera which makes it fun and handy.Overall a perfect buy at this price range."
19,Santhosh,Good basic 5G phone,4.0,7,9,2021,1,31,"Cons:1. Charger Adapter is only 15W Fast Charging unit. It takes  nearly 2 hours to get fully charged2. Charger wire length is less than 2 feet (comparatively less to the normal length of Charger wire )3. Fully charged phone will stand only 1 day if we use the phone at full level (use internet + calls ) through out the day.Pros:1. We can use secure folder option for securing confidential info/apps and data when we hand over the phone to some body either using finger print or pin or a pattern which is different from phone pattern.2. I got phone with RAM of 6 GB and installed several apps and used , phone doesn't show any slow down in speed.3. Finger print sensor at side switch on/off button seems to be attractive."
20,shubham,Fully satisfied,5.0,6,9,2021,1,42,
21,Alka,Premium 5g phone,5.0,21,9,2021,1,25,I just loved this phone using it now for about 20-25 days. Ordered it the same day of it‚Äôs launch and the best part received my phone within 24 hours . Qualities which are winning my heart are :1. It‚Äôs premium look give more class to the phone2. It‚Äôs a perfect size phone with 16.55 cm huge screen and still it‚Äôs a light weight phone very convenient to carry.3. Battery back up is amazing . It gives 24 hours or even more performance with wifi which is amazing .4. It‚Äôs quad camera setup gives you best pictures and again quality is just amazing .5. Selfie camera gives you perfect selfie which is 13MP.6. Lock censors work superb .7. Sound quality is amazing and very soothing to ears .8. Quality of screen is amazing.9. Performance is also great .10. Samsung has given all the premium feature in this range with perfect storage space.My reason for choosing this phone was it‚Äôs 5g 12 band network support but with this i got all the premium features. I am super happy with my choice . Thanks Samsung.
22,Amazon Customer,Conned by Samsung and AMAZON,1.0,25,9,2021,1,27,"The worst phone I've ever purchased!1.Battery: very poor, battery drains quickly and takes 2.5 hours to fully charge a phone in idle mode. False commitment of fast changing and useless 5000mah battery!2.The phone keeps getting hang, if using 3-4 apps simultaneously.3. The Camera is worse! Front cam is 3rd class. You have a better camera in M31 Samsung, which is cheaper than this.I had bought this phone on 13th sept 21, and had raised a replacement on 20th sept on this app, and chose 22nd as a date for technician visit. (I was given an option by amazon app from 21st to 25th).The technician didn't visit on 22nd and I called customer service dept to check about it. They informe that replacement window had already past on 21st, then I asked why was I given an option by this app for a technical visit on 22nd? Then he raised the same concern with his managet and said I'll be getting a reply soon.I didn't get any response, so I contacted the customer service dept again today, the higher dept to which this issue was raised has resolved it without informing and is not willing to talk to me.They have considered this phone fit without  physically verifying, and are not willing to communicate the application glitch which allowed me to book a technician visit which was on the next day of the last replacement day.Very good amazon! Thank you for this experience. This will be the last time I will be ordering an electronic item from you."
23,Prashant sonwani,"Screen is damaged, Not starting from 2 weeks",1.0,27,9,2021,1,25,"I bought the phone with expectations of high end performance but The phone is over priced by 10000/- and it started having pixel line issue which was all over the left side of screen in 2 days, then the phone is not starting up. luckily It happend on 6th day so I was able to request for replacement but little did I know that it will not be easy.Replacement was cancelled because the phone is not starting and they needed IMEI number for verification which I already informed to amazon,I have contacted customer service multiple times but they always say that the phone will be returned easily but it has not returned till this date. They said they have filed a compliant against logistics department but no resolution till this date.There were two instances when they didn't even bother to come pick up location and cancelled the pickup.I am complaining in the consumer forum because it is clearly fraud.Worst phone and worst service by Amazon.Don't buy this phone. Go for 10k range phone."
24,Teju,Really Good Phone avoid negetive reviews,5.0,12,9,2021,1,29,The phone is best . not for heavy games and all really a good mobile with a great battery backup.

26,prince,Product is missing.Very very Disappointed.,1.0,3,10,2021,1,25,Box seal damage.Everyone please be aware
27,Amit Prasad,Phone features are ok but Samsung should consider amoled display in this price segment,4.0,5,9,2021,1,21,Phone features are ok but Samsung should consider amoled display in this price segment. Although screen is very clear comparative to other brands but it should be sAmoled.
28,Swapnil Varute,Must buy it,5.0,12,9,2021,1,16,"I was very disappointed because First I received my mobile with crack on Backside of mobile,  but thanks to Amazon team , they replaced my mobile with new one within 1 day , really appreciated their quick decision and response,  about product,  phone is amazing with all features....must buy & try it.."
29,Sachin K,"Fast draining batter, replacement option is not honoured.",1.0,27,9,2021,1,17,"Battery of Mobile device is what energy is to a living being. M32 5g has a very poor battery. Had bought this branded device with much expectations but this device's poor battery performance has let me down. Above all, replacement request was also not honoured by Amazon."
30,Srinithi,Don't buy from Amazon.. Return/replacement policy worst.,1.0,14,9,2021,1,16,I bought samsung M32 mobile last week.it It's mobile speaker was not working good. mobile speaker was too low audible while speaking calls..I want replace my but Amazon technician said it is good working I am booked for another inspection I feel dissappointing. Dont buy this product from Amazon return/replacement policy is too bad.
31,Amazon Customer,Worst mobile,1.0,17,9,2021,1,17,"Samsung M32 5G is a rubbish mobile from Samsung and more than that Amazon has a return and replace policy.  No return even if there is a problem with the product.  Remove Friends Samsung and Amazon from your life.  Both are waste of money and waste of time.  Amazon does not replace even after giving a bad mobile.  If there is such a policy, who will buy the product online?"
32,ASHOK YADAV,Wonderful phone within reasonable price.,5.0,7,9,2021,1,18,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Sound is not enough but can be adjusted."
33,Pratimanikhare,Not my expectations,1.0,9,9,2021,1,19,Vestage of money produt display not good
34,Mrinmoy,Bad to worst experience,1.0,4,11,2021,1,13,"First let me give a review of the mobile. I bought 8 and 128gb version. Overall is good. But it says it's fast charging but to charge it from 20% to 100% it's taking more than 2 hours. And with moderate use the battery will last for 30 odd hours, including the night time when we are not using it atall. Got the product on 30th October. After using for 2days suddenly the display was not working properly and after 10-15minutes it went totally blank. Now nothing is visible. Display totally gone.Tried to raise a replacement but as per Amazon a technical person will visit and check, and after his report they will proceed further. Ok, no issues with this, but the slot they gave is after 5days. They are delevering your product in 1day after you have ordered, but if there is any issue , them they are taking more than a week to replace it. That's not acceptable. Let's see what happens after the technician visit. Will provide the next updateGot the new phone after 10days. It was a very very bad experience while returning the product. Technician was scheduled after 3 days i raised request but no one showed up, got no calls from them. No one picked my call. I was told to reschedule it. I did for a time slot of 10 AM to 2PM (again after 48hours). Again no one came. I called to amazon customer and they told me to again reschedule. I dropped 3 mails escalating it. Then the techinicain called me and came after 6PM.I finally got the phone replaced on 10th November.The camera is not as good as it shoud be. Battery is bad. It takes more than 2.5 hours to full charge and stays for just over a day. (I dont play games on phone)"
35,NG,Pride of India - Great phone,5.0,16,9,2021,1,11,This product is one of the best made in india product from Samsung and I recommend to go everyone in mid range phones with high features . Go for it and cons is actually nothing but if price they can bring down to 19k will be rocking and can create revolution in the mid segment of phones.Truely a monster and 5G oriented mobile ‚Ä¶
36,Sonamani Irengbam,"5 star had given today 2 star, I see many fault day by day",2.0,26,9,2021,1,11,"I had written a good review but today I am very sorry, this phone hang and stuck frequently I would say, overall this fon is Not a good one, sometime it switched off automatically, I have to go to servicing center, samsung you need some upgrade to fulfill the heart of a customer"

Tried many many times adding fingers and changing it, but reader quality is very badCharging cable received in the box is very small. Power adapter is of poor quality.Loud speaker is not at all loudOverall not very happy being a Samsung customer and Samsung product."
38,Sharath,Model flop,2.0,6,9,2021,1,13,I personally  felt  display and front cam  ok ok but atleast rear cam for 23k 48mp its not good quality also. I am preferred to buy Samsung  but not this model
39,S Prabhu,Fashionable,4.0,14,9,2021,1,9,"Gorgeous Blue glass body. Quick charge. Good screen, but not Crystal Clear. Samsung Apps are Confusing. Little heavier. Battery holding not that longer for the given capacity.THE PHONE HAD A FALL. SERVICE CENTRE CHARGED RS. 4400/  FOR REPLACEMENT OF SCREEN."
40,kumar shantveerayya,It's not worthy avoid buying,3.0,9,10,2021,1,7,"1) Battery  drains out fast which is  important  parameter as we r using 4G network still, if 5G then we need to avoid  buying it2) Specification says its fast charging but it takes 3 hours to charge full.3) Camera is not  much good as expected.4) As it has 8gb ram internet and other operations works faster.5) brightness  is not much6) Sim slot opening  pin was not given which is very basic thing7) charger cable is short, if they increase .25mFor the above points makes me to dislike üëé this product."
41,Hitesh Patel,"Not satisfied as value,  poor futures",1.0,8,10,2021,1,9,"Mera tv me Screen mirrors nahi hota, Remote nahi he, infra red nahi he, pdf file open nahi hoti, speed 8 gb jaisa nahi he, finger print senser kuch khas nahi he, unlock karne ke bar bar pin dalni padti he,  muze bilkul pasand nahi ye ye galaxy phone, waste of money.

42,Dinesh J,Over heat issues while charge and speaking,2.0,16,9,2021,1,7,I have brought this phone during the first day of launch. I was expecting something better could be involved in this mobile but literally waste. Phone is getting heating issues while we speak any calls for appx 10 to 15 mins. I have started seeing hand pain issues after using this phone within a week. Its feels very heavy while using it. Its better to look for some other less weights phone to work.
43,Vijayakumar SP,An another Disappointing product from Samsung.,3.0,8,11,2021,1,5,"I bought a 8GB+128GB version. This 5000MAH battery is a useless one.On first day the phone was unplugged at 100% recharge at 7PM Saturday & battery drained to 25% by 11.30AM on sunday. The Battery Save mode was ON all the time. No calls made & most of the time the phone was lying in idle. Just 5 hours of light browsing was made.Again today unplugged by 5AM & by 4.30PM the battery drained to 48% with 3hrs of browsing usage, no calls made & kept idle most of the time.Yet another unreliable heavily speculated product from samsung india üí©ü§Øüëé.My 5 year old Moto G5S+ 3000MAH battery is doing the same job after all these time of heavy use üëèüëè Kudos Motorola.Imagine what the gamers could use this useless phone of meger battery life.The so called 15W Fast charger is outdated & bulky, an useless accesorie. It takes 3 hours to full charge this handset. üê¢üò§ü§¨If customers have the chance to get refund for this product as per 7 days replacement policy then undoubtedly everyone will choose that option & get rid of this sxxt phone.Most of the time the screen response is also cheap. So diificult or even non-responsive to copy OTP or other messages from the screen."
44,Santosh Raman Mishra,It takes 3 hours to charge phone,1.0,5,10,2021,1,10,3 hours to charge and heating issue with phone and very hard attitude of Amazon to refund. Phone sicks

48,Prasad naik,Excellent 5G phone from samsung,5.0,14,9,2021,1,7,Have been using it from last 2 weeks and have charged once in 3 days. Screen in excellent compared to my earlier Samsung m 31s phone.speed of phone is also superb
49,GD,Great phone,5.0,11,9,2021,1,8,"This phone delivers the performance it promises. RAM, battery life, camera, processor too good. Samsung smart switch app removed all the hassles of changing the phone."
50,sanjeev,Not value for money,1.0,13,9,2021,1,9,"At this cost, lots of options are available in market with far superior configuration."
51,JAGMOHAN K,"Worst ever camera clarity unresponsive finger print reader, didn't expect this from samsung",1.0,11,11,2021,1,4,"Worst ever camera clarity, unresponsive fingerprint reader and face reader takes time more than 5 sec.Call clarity not upto the mark...Only good thing is design and space 128 gb and 8 gb ram..Not at all worthy product for 22000...Don't go by just for 5g network alone... Consider many other facts too..Enough fast for games and display I feel it's bad... Could have provided amoled or super amoled display... Ips display clarity is giving a cheaper look.Sound is good enough to hear and attend calls..Not sure how many days will this display last...Fast charging is okay with 15 w charger..In box accesories doesn't include basic silicon cover.. had to separately buy that..Battery life is goodI could suggest PPL to go for m31 as it's Camera clarity, battery and space are at good level.."
52,AJEET SINGH DAMOR,Don't Buy This Product,1.0,9,11,2021,1,10,"The media could not be loaded.

53,M vijay bhasker reddy,5g mobile from Samsung with more features.,5.0,21,9,2021,1,4,"I liked phone with fast charging, big battery and performance wise, but I am to buy another phone, if it comes nearly 6500mah battery, gaming processor, ram with extended, better software with anti-virus and security. Now this phone is nice."
54,Ravi,Just an average mobile phone withou OTG support,2.0,11,10,2021,1,3,"Writing after 1 week.Major problems -1. fast battery discharge during internet browsing and doesn't last for 10 hours in the new phone.2. Over Heating problem during the online video (from youtube Facebook tweeter etc.) plays on 4G network.3. Does not support OTG USB storage device. Always promot to format your 3TB external hard disk. Do not buy, if you want to use external storage device via OTG adapter. Visited service center, but no success.Display is just ok with bigger screen size.Camera is ok.Phone is bulky but looking nice and sturdy.Sound is amazingly loud and clean without headphone.Fingerprint is very sensitive and sometimes irrigating too when it unlocks mistakenly. LoL.Overall a good phone to buy if you focus on technical configuration and security of data with Knox.Hopefully, next software update will fix the overheating problem and quick battery drainage.I will update the review after a while again."
55,Amazon Customer,Big Regret ..and end up with frustration,1.0,28,10,2021,1,4,"Looking at specs, everything seems good, but actual story starts when u use it.Display is very poor, just try watching any video, picture blurs. This can be tolerate, but real issue is it hangs several times a day for no reason and u will not be able to understand the reason. Network lost for no reason, calls unable to connect. And u can not return it.Very poor product by Samsung."
56,Ashok sharma,Worst battery backup 56% drained in just 3hr,1.0,5,10,2021,1,7,Worst battery backup. And worst video call experience

59,Rahul,Really a monster like the tag line,5.0,21,9,2021,1,4,Very fast to use differen apps like a monster. No hang ups. Look is good.  Battery  charging is faster. Picture quality is very good. After this phone I have become photographer of the house. Should buy this product.
60,Jitu,Display colour issue... Resolved after software update,3.0,19,9,2021,1,5,Mobile display colours issue has been solved by sumsung service center team. Now mobile is working fine only charging is very slow not as said fast charging.
61,Nitin Pathekar,"Worst phone ,made biggest mistake",1.0,27,10,2021,1,3,This phone equipped with quad camera setup but trust me none of them works properly.Low light or indoor photos taken from this phone are extremely worst.If looking for a phone for camera purpose then this phone is not recommended.Their are couple of other options available in other brands may perform better than this phone.
62,Sobin,Product quality could be better,3.0,19,10,2021,1,2,"I have purchased this product in the Amazon sale and had it delivered on 15th Oct 2021. So far these are my observations -1. The phone has amazing battery life2. Never heats up3. Calls are clearly audible4. Apps load fast5. Body looks and feels durableDislikes:1. Samsung, please understand my dog collar is longer than the USB cord. Suppose I am in a railway station and want to charge my phone from a plug point 4ft up without a dock, should I stand and hold the phone till 15W charges charges the device? What's with the short power cord?2. Screen in reading mode flickers. This is visible from day one. I am not initiating the return only because the device seems to hold up without malfunctioning. But in reading more, that flicker very much is visible.3. This is for buyers. If you're a camera person, straightaway skip this device. It has basic camera settings which was common 5 years ago. no aperture settings, shots look bland4. Is it too much to ask for a free screen guard with the phone that's charged a premium just for 5G bandwidth? Xiaomi is doing it and so are others5. Lower the cost as soon as possible. This phone is not worth 17000. I would put it in the ballpark of 12000-150006. Slowest and probably clumsiest face unlock - slow, lethargic, and not accurate. Probably because the camera isn't great"
63,BISWANATH MAHANTY,"Looks good as of now, some new features",4.0,19,9,2021,1,4,"Looks good, have smart features that we expect from a phone in this price range. Screen recorder is good feature. Finger print scanner cum power key is highly sensitive. Screen looks somehow pixelated."
64,Rani,Samsung has turned out to be unreliable.,3.0,11,10,2021,1,2,"M32 5G is NOT a 5G upgraded variant of M32. The specs of M32 is good, but M32 5G is not so. M32 5G is not that great a phone which I found out after 3 days of use. With medium usage of calls and mobile data like watsapp, browsing, mail, shopping, the battery manages to squeeze past 12 hours. For heavy users, this phone will not be a good choice.Amazon needs to revise their return policy. In a brick and mortar store, within a week if such issues are observed, the store would surely replace with another model as per client's requirement. Nowadays, Amazon is asking too many questions when it comes to return or replacement.What do I do if I feel the phone is too heavy in my hands? Am I stuck with it just because I bought it on Amazon?"
65,Rajagopal S,Fingerprint and battery problem,3.0,25,9,2021,1,3,"For reference: Previously used realme 3pro1. Fingerprint is not functioning properly, quite often it's not responding even restarted several times.2. Type C charger only, but take 2hrs to full from 5%. Lenevo zuk z2 also type C charger, but it took 45mins to full(once used). Realme also took less time only.3. 3 finger slide down screenshot, especially you can't take screenshots on playing videos."

69,Ashwinder Singh,Poorly designed product,1.0,4,12,2021,1,0,The fingerprint sensor is not ergonomically shaped and placed.Samsung has ruined the android experience by overloading the phone with their own crappy appsThe interface itself serves advertisements. It defeats the purpose of buying a phone from a reputed brand.Touch experience is sub-par.The AI loaded over camera makes photos cringy.Screencasting to other than samsung TV is not successful.Display quality is average.Overall better to buy the second in line brands instead of this.Lots of friends recommend me to buy this brand but it is simply not worth the hype.The blutooth has started malfunctioning. it disconnects the devices midway.Already a distinctive slowing down of the device is evident.The inbuilt cringe worthy samsung apps are irritating and they can not be disabled.

I mean samsung should standarise some basic features in all phone. M31 has a hand gesture screenshot and next level does not have this basic feature. It really is disappointing. Features are basic as like that of 4 to 5k phone. Only 5g sim capability.dont have a choice as cant keep spending on phones like these. 18k is a huge amount.Opnion dont buy thinking it must be next level because of 5G sim feature.

82,Devesh,Mobile is for old aged people,1.0,24,11,2021,1,0,The Finger sensor is on the side and we Indians usually put cover on the mobile to prevent it from any sort of damage & this cover causes nuisance while reading the finger sensor.The camera are of average quality.Earlier I had S7 worth Rs.52000 which doesn't have any problembut M32 has a Voice DROP problem and range DROP problem . I can understand the Call or Voice  drop when I am in the lift but when I am sitting or walking on straight lane/road the call automatically DROPS and I have to call back the person over again & again. Good that now-adays we have unlimited calling. but the phone is really BAD.I do not play games. No comments on how battery is affected when we play games

87,Paresh Variya,Manufacturing Defect for WiFi,1.0,25,10,2021,1,1,This M32 model has manufacturing defect of WIFI tethering. It stop sharing/exchanging data after few minutes. Amazon is not taking responsibility for this other than giving replacement of 1 time only. So be careful. Battery life is also not good as it drains fast. Charging speed is not up to satisfactory mark compare to other brands. Overall product (M32) is not worth and waste of money.

Touch doesn't always work the way it should.The only upside is a slightly better chip and 5G 12 band compatibility.The only reason I got this phone was because it was 5G with 12 bands and i got the 8GB RAM version for 19k with 6 month accidental screen replacement guarantee."

For the 32 5G microphone is not working when put on speaker and for M32 speaker volume is too low that person could hardly hear.Though these phones are made in India and I don't know if Samsung has imported  speaker and microphone from China to make in India cheap phones.Secondly, all android phones can copy apps from previous phones from your email IDs but Samsung phones are not designed allows you do that....it's a sorry phone"

But after using for over a month and even comparing to my earlier 5 year old MI Redmi Pro, Samsung M32 is a big BIG letdown on performance clumsy features, Intermittent problems with faulty Internet, Battery runs out fast even after enabling all the batter saver features that samsung offers, these are just to say a few! No innovative feature to talk about! I feel transported back in history with this phone! And not to mention, for the price POOR value delivered!"

This model is not good as it lacks some key features and also the body in not that rigid. Only addition on which Samsung is pricing it higher is 5G compatibility and honestly its not a reason that the model must priced way higher.All in all, I am going to bear with this set as I have bought it already but I would suggest other to look for other models available from other companies in the same price point as they will be way better than this.This set is a waste of money"

107,Homie,'Samsung' A brand you can trust upon.,5.0,23,12,2021,1,0,"Well i have used SONY, NOKIA, ASUS & MI handsets. So, I'll give you a comparative analysis.Samsung does a decent job in providing clean UI and apps. The mobile battery doesn't last much longer than chinese varaints that offer bigger battery power than this, at such a price range.Camera quality is fair. Front Cam is good, not satisfied with the back ones. Macro cam is also good.Samsung Doesn't provides much functions into camera app as compared to Chinese devices.BUT, the photo quality produced is good, and the noise is very little even after you zoom it, which you won't get in chinese phones like MI.ASUS(Good), NOKIA(Better), SONY(Best) produce better images.The look of the mobile is very good.THE SAMSUNG HARDWARE & SOFTWARES ARE GOOD UNLIKE CHINESE VARIANTS.So, Go for brands like Samsung, Sony, Nokia, if you want your mobile for long run."

112,Amazon Customer,A big NO,1.0,3,1,2022,1,0,A big NO. Regretting the choice.- camera is very poor at this price range. Works like 10k mobile camera. Picture quality is disastrous in low light.- screen casting (smart view) option not there. Which you can get in low budget smartphones- finger print reader not working properly. Annoyed with its functionality.- charging is very slow.- mobile is bet heavy to carry(but thats ok)You can get better featured smart phones with other brands. choose wisely as you are investing your money
113,Williams,Good phone,3.0,28,11,2021,1,0,"My first phone was a ZTE foldable CDMA since I opted for Tata Indicom. I loved it as it had so many features not available in the GSM phone that my friends had. When it stopped working, can you believe, I got a Huawei which was not so good but I used it for a year. Then I got a Samsung Wideo which accepted a CDMA SIM. Just loved it. Was heavy, bulky and odd but it made an impression whenever I used it. It was replaced by a candy bar Samsung. Both the device were replaced since the battery died. By this time CDMA handsets were rare the only one that accepted a CDMA SIM was the Honor Holly 3 Plus. It was okay. It accepted calls but CDMA data could not be activated. I replaced it with the Honor 9 Lite which was superb. Dropped it a couple of times but it still works. But it was time for a replacement. No Honor phone was available neither online nor on the shops. So I decided to buy from a brand I know. I had high hopes on this phone but it just wasn't as good as the Honor 9 Lite."
114,Faisal,Very bad experience,1.0,9,12,2021,1,1,Worst worst worst. First time ever brought a phone online and experience was verryy verryy bad. Never expected this from a brand like Samsung. The software hangs and every 1 hour it asks for a download and after clicking on download it does'nt even download. Very very upset with the product. Will never buy samsung online again. Personal advice Please go to a store and buy the phone rather than online.
115,Subhojit Dey,Mistakenly Brought Mobile,3.0,12,10,2021,1,0,When companies are giving amoled lcd led hd+ fhd+ screen in 10k pricing and samsung has bought us TFT screen in 16-17k it's really a mistake to buy this. Look wise the phone is good and features are so so for this price range. I don't know much about this mediatek dimensity 700 ram but i can say in this pricing samsung should opt for a low range of Snapdragon SoC which differs a lot from any dimensity processors. All in the end I would not suggest people to buy this phone at this pricing as this phones price should have 10k-11k of range. Please Don't Buy !!!

But The problem is with the Seller & Amazon.And I feel this problem happens with every, different phones, selling by Amazon or the Seller.After delivery of this M32 5G phone, I didn't get any physical Invoice inside the delivery box. So I downloaded the invoice from Amazon app. After downloading it, I don't get the Serial no. & IMEI no. mentioned on the invoice, like how the offline shops mention every details about the phone on invoice .So, the problem is, whenever I visit service center for any service related to this phone, and the service center ask me to show the invoice for claiming warranty benifits.But, if the IMEI no. & Serial no. not mentioned on the invoice, then how the service center indentify that the invoice is registered for the same product.Problem from Amazon-After understanding the problem, immediately I contacted Amazon Customer Care by 06/11/2021. Then I explained all the issues to the customer care executive. So the executive asked me to provide all the images of IMEI no. & Serial No. mentioned on the mobile and box,  image of Amazon Delivery Box & the images of  invoice, pay slip.Then the customer care executive confirmed all the documents and raised a TT. Then told me to wait for 10 days, so, I'll get a new invoice with the IMEI & Serial no.After 9 days I contacted again. Then I got to know that, there's some error because of one image was not cleared. So, again I had to raise a new TT with new required documents and again have to wait for 10 days excluding holidays.They didn't even notify me about this error. If I didn't contact again, then I never got to know about this issue.So, If I am getting these much problem from  online Store. Then it's good to purchase from any offline store.And also asking to all the buyers to check with your invoices with any mobile phone you purchased online."

I saw condition of phone,there was liquid, but it is not a water or generally used liquid.... It's uncommon liquid and it's proven by their customer executive...After that I called Amazon customer care, they told me that your product must be repaired at no cost or replaced.. I waited 4 days.... Still no reply...... Again I called them... Again they gave me same reply.. Again I waited.... After that I called again and they said.... Your product couldn't be repaired or replaced......I am stuck after spending lots of money on this product... üòíüòíüòíüòíüòí"
125,Vijay Kumar,Samsung M32 5G '3 rating' for performance not for camera,3.0,18,1,2022,1,0,I give rating based on my experience.- I like the performance of this device which is very fast from my previous mobile- Not much satisfy with the display which have an TFT which experience like holding 10k budget mobile display experience as using previously AMoled Gorrilla Display which is far better then this one.- Dual aap feature have it but not have flexibily like 'Mi Mix 2' have like you can split / dual app apps to configure 2 accounts within single mobile- Charging not fast as i think or describe in the product description via online- Camera Quality not good and just put 48 MP tag onto box to get customer/buyerOverall experience I can say it ok worth for those looking device for performance wise not camera perspective.

127,Hari Pradeep,Not so great camera.,3.0,12,11,2021,1,0,"Not much happy.Battery is good as we can get for a full day for a moderate use. I took it for my wife, she only use it for whatsapp, teams, emails and calls purpose only. Camera quality is disappointing. Pictures taken from this are not so clear. Both front and back cameras need to be improved.Her previous moto g6 phone Pictures are way better compared to this.I could have opted for other brand in this range."

129,Ashish Nagargoje,Not worth to money at all,2.0,7,2,2022,1,1,"It may be good phone for some people, but seriously not worth to 23000/- at all. You don't get feel of 23k. I got camera who captures photos like VGA and blur. 48 mpx ? No. Performance wise ok ok but if you love photography, I don't recommend it."
130,Amazon Customer,Very poor product and disappointing.,1.0,16,10,2021,1,1,"I wanted to return the product, and even asked for upgrade if possible. However, No such options were provided. I had tried all possible options to sort out the issue, but of no use. Even technician's visit were scheduled twoice. On both the occasions the technicians never visited, but closed the case as having resolved the issuse automatically at the end of visit schedule."
131,KUMAR KUMAR,Worst product with double game played by Amazon.,1.0,23,2,2022,1,0,We requested to return both mobile and insurance but when they came to take insurance they have taken mobile and refunded insurance amount to me. Neither I have mobile nor amount now for mobile. When I asked they are saying they can't do anything now. They are not giving delivery partner details also.

Non-display of mobile number causes inability for internet banking.  Total time wasting process."
134,"Xavier Alexander, M.",5G,4.0,31,1,2022,1,0,"No dedicated lot for SD card.  So if you are using one, like a single sim mobile.  Battery is limited.  No heating issues.  4G network is OK but if you are using 3G (BSNL) horrible. Very limited coverage (as I have it as second sim). Front camera quality is good especially for video calls."

¬†I'm in love with this product and I prefer Samsung brand . It's of sky blue color and it has all the trendy features like QR code scanner captures very well, Good fingerprint reader, excellent battery life and fine macro camera quality. It's only drawback I can say is that it has low memory of 6GB ROM . Thank you Amazon for delivering this product with the coolest offer."
136,SHANTANU KULKARNI,A good budget phone,4.0,12,11,2021,1,0,"The phone has all the features that you would want in a budget phone. It has fast usb C charging, good display and 5g capabilities.What I did not like was the sound quality of the speaker. A part of which is due to the phone frame being made of plastic. Also the overall materials used for making the phone are not that good. The power button/fingerprint scanner is a bit difficult to use."
137,S.S,Totally dissatisfied.,1.0,17,12,2021,1,0,"Paying so much for a mobile and getting such a bad camera quality is just not justified. Camera doesn't take focus, suddenly a whole lot of light fills the screen. Aisa quality toh 7k ke phone mein mil jata hai. really disheartening that amazon doesnt even give you an option to return the phone and book a better one. Very bad policy, first of all by seeing the features & review we have to purchase.. after that if we dont like the phone we dont get an option to return it..there's only one option that is ""book a technician"", even the technician doesn't turn up after calling back. like what is this!!! I am spending an amount and i cant choose my preferred phone just because you dont take it back, my money gets wasted."

Feels quite bulky sometimes."
143,Gaurav,Take it for 5g,3.0,25,10,2021,1,0,"It's overall a good product. Phone uses 20gb internal memory so, u r left with 108gb. Both cameras are okayish but not for photography. Battery life is good but takes 2hrs to charge from 15% to full. Display is average you can find blurriness even if u play in 1080p. I don't play games so I don't know about game performance. Fingerprint detection is quick. I don't want to buy any phone for next few years. So, 5g is the only reason i took this phone and one of the important specification but we can't say anything about 5g performance till it launches in India."
144,Raz,Not good as thought,3.0,28,11,2021,1,0,"I bought 2 months back. Price was good due to bank offer. But for its retail price you can buy other company phone like MI Lite 11 or Oneplus. The Good Part Battery Back up. Most Worst part its Finger sensor location which will be hindrance when u work in the phone. while in any application widget shortcut (quick drop down buttons) will appear due to sensing the finger when u hold the phone. Except for communication apps duel apps cannot be installed but OPPO ,REDMI, MI can"

159,Sobin Mathew,Low Quality Product,2.0,5,11,2021,1,0,I bought this only because of it has 5G. But disappointed. My 4 year old Honor 9 Lite is far superior than this cheap Samsung.Major Issues:1. Display quality is very poor. One will get a phone with better display for Rs.8000.2. Touch Screen lags and miss many events. I had a low cost Honor phone with far better touch screen.3.Its very heavy with below average sound quality.Now trying to get rid of this Samsung.

Also there is a problem with the device. Automatically the notification tone starts ringing unstoppable which is so irritating and you will be forced to switch of your device to get rid from that.
168,Murali,WIFI CALLING NOT WORKING,1.0,13,11,2021,1,0,Samsung Galaxy M32 the WIFI CALLING does not work. It worked a few days after the purchase and one day WIFI CALLING stopped working. I googled and tried various suggestions including factory reset. Finally I took it to the Samsung service center and after upgrading software it still did not work. Then they tried it with another SIM and it worked. So they told it is a SIM problem and asked me to replace the SIM. I went to Airtel service and got a new SIM. Still it does not work...

Camera quality is OK, not the best I must say in this price range. If you buy a phone in this price range you expect it to work good. While typing this review my battery got drained from 38% to 35 %. This is the reality folks.And when you want to replace it. They will send an 'expert' who will run a diagnose function in your phone. And in the end will say your battery is OK. So you can't even replace it."
