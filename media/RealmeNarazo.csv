1,A Balaji,Nothing new except Performance,2.0,28,10,2021,1,125,"First of all those who wants best performance phones can buy this and don't expect anything other than this.Pros:Super performanceBattery lifeRealme UI 2.0Cons:1. Camera ( Worst even if it 50MP it takes pictures like 5MP. Front camera is too dull.  My old Redmi 4 phone gives good front cam quality than this. Front cam worst.2. Display (It gives 360pixel output when videos Play in 720p. Even 720p wallpaper also displays like 320p)At least they should give FHD display.Even 9K price we get FHD display.3. No case provided, no inbuilt tamper glass( For this price these to be included in the box)4. Last but not the least, Overpriced. These featured phone to be come in 9000/-This is my review frnds, those who needs only performance can buy this. For other features don't buy."
2,Ramakrishna,Worst product ever,1.0,9,10,2021,1,114,Most worst part of it is Amazon is backing it and causing problems to the customer. Please don't buy this product especially from Amazon. In India there is trust issues..
3,Amazon Customer,Defective Product,1.0,12,10,2021,1,104,battery issue and SIM card slot 2nd not working; Call Amazon Customer support they are not even trying to help me over this issue saying you need to wait for some time instead also checked by their tech support team in all ways by downloading the app and performing the test.So not recommended the Purchase of a Phone over Amazon like a lot of issues and not resolution with Tech-Support.Rather buy from somewhere else.

23,jagdish maity,Defective item,1.0,10,10,2021,1,7,Very disappointed with the service. I was not expecting this kind of service from Amazon. Product is new but defective. I want full refund of my payment and no other charges should be deducted.
24,Zebulon,FOR BASIC USE ONLY,4.0,3,3,2022,1,1,"I strictly recommend this phone for Basic and normal use only like Casual calls, long calls, Google apps, YouTube, video streaming apps,etc.Gaming- NO NO NO!CAMERA- 2/10 Horrible the pictures captured are soo bad it feels cheap , it's not sharp. so if your looking for a good camera performance this phone sucks.BATTERY-  9/10 Really good.DISPLAY- 9/10 Amazing I'm surprised and impressed with the display quality i can barely notice minor differences between this phone and my poco F1.Overall- 3/5 Gud for basic and normal use or a secondary phone for calls or watching videos on YouTube."
25,Aakash,Great value for money,5.0,15,12,2021,1,3,"If you are looking for a budget smartphone that has good battery life, then definitely go for this. The charging time is a bit too much but justifies because it has a 6000MaH battery. The overall performance and UI of Color OS are pretty good which was astonishing because I thought it would be like MI phones which turned out to be wrong. Realme is doing a good job by making such budget smartphones. Would love this phone if it has a higher charging speed, an AMOLED screen, a good camera with a wide-angle lens. Apart from that, it is perfect."
26,Gerrard,Best Phone in this Price,5.0,3,3,2022,1,4,"Superb body with wonderful exterior finish.Camera is surprisingly good at this price! Night photography is far better than any phone in this range. And it‚Äôs actually very good.Superb battery life and sound quality.Connectivity is also amazing, voice clarity and mic are great.In 2 month usage, phone never hang or behave weirdly. Quite smooth for my purpose, in which I don‚Äôt play games at all. So mind that.Quite an amazing phone for this range. Go for it."
27,Himanshu,Bad phone quality,1.0,11,1,2022,1,4,Within one month the phone has stopped working. The network signal connection stopped working on this phone. We tested it with few sims that worked on other phones but the moment we put the sim in this realms phone the signal would just not connect. Bad experience ! Cannot return or exchange. Feel cheated!!
28,Juben raju,phone ok,3.0,9,10,2021,1,5,Issue only Charger box(big Box look like) other all things everything perfect Thank you Real me
29,Vikas Singh,The biggest drawback of this phone is that it is not full HD.,4.0,14,3,2022,1,0,"I was looking for a smartphone for my father which comes under ‚Çπ 10000. The smartphone should have almost all the features that are in this segment of realme but all the good features proved to be dwarfed by just one feature and that is; The screen of this phone is not full HD. If Realme fulfills this shortcoming, then surely the phone of any other brand other than this phone does not stand anywhere in this segment, yet if this phone is getting a good offer then it is prudent to buy it."
30,Khuma Ram,Better than samsun in this price!!!,4.0,8,1,2022,1,1,"This is the honest review,1)Phone is very fast and fluid,2) fingerprint and face unlock is ultra fast3) camera could have been better but ok for the budget4) bettery life is amazing5) fast os app update is fasterThe missing thing is super amoled screen but ok for the budget ,internal Sound quality is not good,  brightness is also amazing, so overall a amazing smartphone!!"

32,Prime member,Best phone without automatic call recorder,5.0,8,1,2022,1,2,"2nd realme after using 6 Pro, this new one will be more convenient for routine tasks. Good looking, optimal UI, quite fast charging, no heating issues, superb camera, though sounds not good.Only drawback automatic call recorder is not there.By the way 1.5 years old realme performance is as good as day1."
33,Rashi,Worst quality of camera and hanging problem,1.0,14,1,2022,1,1,Camera quality is worst.and it hangs continuously after one day use.i never been experiencing like this.its service is pathetic.now I cant even return or replace it . whenever I want to play songs on wynkmusic..it hang .I have been using redmi and vivo before this company..nd I was happy with both of them..but this realme product is just worst..I bought it for camera purpose.but it is worst.dont buy this phone ...nd one more last thing.i never reviewed any products here on Amazon before it but it will help you so I reviewed it
34,Rajan....,DIDN'T MEET EXPECTATIONS,3.0,19,11,2021,1,0,"Average performance in such price range. More value for money is expected from Realme.1. Average Camera Quality. Definitely not real 50 MP. Not more than 13 MP.2. Below Average Refresh Rate in this price.3. Infinix offers better phones in 30 % lesser cost and better features.4. Getting just 40% exchange value for just a month old device.5. No Back Case and screen protector.6. Looks Good but delivers less.REALME PUT THEIR PRODUCTS IN EOL ""End of Life"" Series right after 12-18 Months.YOU WON'T GET THE CONSUMABLES LIKE BATTERY AND OTHER PARTS EVEN FROM THEIR AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTRES. I EXPERIENCED THE SERVICE RELATED ISSUE WITH MY PREVIOUS PHONE REALME U1. I HAD TO SELL IT FOR PEANUTS.REALME EXPECTS PEOPLE TO MAKE PEOPLE BUY A WHOLE PRODUCT INSTEAD OF ENSURING THE AVAILABILITY OF PAID SERVICE AND SPARE PARTS FOR ATLEAST 3 YEARS."
35,kamal patel,Honest reviews,3.0,14,2,2022,1,1,"Processor : perfect no issueEvery aspect of phone is perfect except below mentioned point.1. Screen is 720p & ppi is 280. Because of law pixel density reading in phone (pdf, other contact) is streassful for eye. Word are not show dark & scrren Sharpness is low.2. Contrass ratio (white compare to black) is also low.3 other colour except white, is nearly perfect because scrren cover 70% ntsc colour space equal to 95%srgb colour gamut.4. Most important phone use mono sound speker for speker output. So. Sound quality is very bad.GOOD POINT1. LONG BATTERY AROUND 2 DAYS2. BIG SCREEN3. CAPABLE OF ANY GAME, & HARD CORE APP4.

But ones charging complete it's provide u good backup. Camera üì∑ is good but not very good as showing..over all parameters are good in this price"
38,shaijal c,Straight line in display,1.0,20,12,2021,1,2,Straight line in display after a week use . I have contacted realme call me service but they asked me to visit service center which is 75 km away from my home. I didn't expect this from company like realme. Disappointed!!!
39,Jay,Value for the money üí∏üí∞,5.0,20,12,2021,1,1,Simple and very  practical design. Fingerprint reader is very fast and well placed. Battery backup is amazing. I never noticed any performance issues in day today usage. In my opinion it is a great phone for this price. My primary phone is a Google Pixel 4xl. Really surprised to see such a great quality phone at this price range. Phone came with Android 11 out of the box with decent UI. We can easily remove unwanted software s using ADB.
40,JITENDRA JOSHI,Mobile is ok. But camera clearly is not good in this megapixel,2.0,28,10,2021,1,5,Mobile is ok. But camera clearly is not good in this megapixel.... Isko update kr ke sudhar karna chahiye...
41,Suman Banerjee,Nice phone with great performance,5.0,6,1,2022,1,0,I am a basic mobile user and according to me this mobile suffice my all requirements. Great battery life with large internal memory and good ram speed. Camera is very nice in day light. Low light photography is not great but I am fine with that. I do not use finger print sensor so not really concerned about its speed. For me it's a great phone with all the required facilities with unmatchable price tag.
42,Damini,Persistent voice disruption issue .... Very disappointed,2.0,24,1,2022,1,1,"Purchased this phone after going through such great reviews... only to recieve a handset with a pathetic sound quality, repititive voice disruption in every damn call....To the extent that one has to cut the ongoing call and call back, only to have the same cycle repeat.Rest of the phone works fine but then the voice disruption is a headache since it's persistently there in every call.Wasn't expecting this at all.Disappointed bigtime.Never gonna go for realme again."
43,SWASTHIKA K,Value for money purchasr,5.0,22,12,2021,1,1,"Ample storage for my parents, enough ram 4gb, battery is not as good as 6000mah but getting back up more than a day, camera justifies in this price range, screen is 720p disappointing, but you cant feel that difference. Sturdy built (how it feels in hand, not for drop test), for 10 its a good phone."
44,Vinoth Kumar Ramachandran,Budget phone at this price (11500),4.0,15,3,2022,1,0,"I purchased this phone @11499 and also I got 5% as cash back through ICICI Amazon credit card. 4GB RAM + 128 GB storage at this price is worth buying. Almost 1 month of usage, I don't find any major issues with the phone. The major concern about this phone is - Sound/Mic. The volume is very low when you see videos (or) speaker phone."
45,shivansh joshi,Phone hang problem with the replacement product too.,1.0,10,1,2022,1,5,"The media could not be loaded.

47,ved prakash,Very bad mobile set.,1.0,11,11,2021,1,1,Narzo 50A is 3 quality Mobile phone. It call and touch very bad. Audio and vedio call not receive in good manners.This take aslo privacy issue at the time call recording it inform to the reciver about recording by voice message. It also create the issue at the time of call merged . This mobile cannot merge calls and when you try to call merge it stop voice calls also you cannot hear caller voice.In my opinion do not purchase this set.it very bad quality Mobile phone.
48,Kushagra Srivastava,Value for money,4.0,23,11,2021,1,0,"I got this phone at 8k in diwali sale after exchange and bank discount. Original price was 12500.Battery backup is excellent and gives me around 36 hours on normal usage like daily phone calls, internet usage, fb insta usage etc except gaming.Camera at this price is more than expected. Selfie camera is a better one and gives you better quality and sharper images.Charging will take a couple of hours to charge fully from 10-20%.Display gives you a better feel to watch hd videos and movies on big screen.If you are getting on or under 10k can surely buy this."
49,Mohit,"Very Small Font size of Shortcuts, No option to enlarge",1.0,22,10,2021,1,3,"Very Small Font size of Shortcuts, No option to enlarge, negative point"
50,Ravi,Please save your money. Don't buy.,1.0,11,1,2022,1,3,Call waiting functionality not working.Data cannot be used on primary sim if on call.Phone not compatible with boat bluetooth headphones voice breaking a lot.
51,Prashant B.,Gaming and day to day tasks.,2.0,23,1,2022,1,0,"This is not a great phone for a gamer like me to be honest. Fingerprint sensor is not accurate and never unlocks in first attempt. Camera is good but it doesn't provide details images, what can you even expect from two 2 MP cams(Nah 50MP can't hit the job done alone it also doesn't capture details). Display is also not that good we can see dark lines around corner and water drop notch. Front cam is good for selfies but it's good for selfie videos. Now let me tell you the worst thing about this device, its touch response. This phone can tell how many fingers are on the screen and that's good but when it comes to gaming I feel like multi-touch is gone. Worst touch response I have ever seen. This device is good for day to day tasks like social media. Speaker and receiver are really good and I am impressed by the audio quality it provides during calls. 60hz refresh rate on display also feels good. Battery life is so impressive that it took me a whole day to bring it on 40%. If you are not interested in gaming then this is a good device for you."
52,Jeyaprakash,Perfect for daily use,4.0,19,1,2022,1,2,"Ordered for my Dad. My keypoints to look was Good battery, decent design and no lags for daily use. No disappointment faced usage wise. But didn't have back cover in the pack, which has become a basic thing in every mobile pack nowadays"
53,Murali Mohan Jasti,Awkward call recording announcement,1.0,29,1,2022,1,0,"The biggest flaw of the phone is that when automatic call recording feature is enabled it gives an awkward announcement saying ""this call is now being recorded"" and it can't be disabled. Despite being eligible for 7 day refund/replacement policy, Amazon denied the refund option saying that no such option exists inspite of it being mentioned in the product page. Amazon is cheating genuine customers and boast about it's customer satisfaction despite of providing such pathetic service. Even after paying 1000 for prime membership if this is what I get it's better I never order anything from Amazon. The customer relationship managers are fit for nothing and don't even want to understand what the customer is trying to explain. Typical scammer mindset. To be honest Amazon doesn't deserve genuine customers. Never experienced such pathetic customer service from any e-commerce site."
54,Amazon Customer,Unmatchable in it's price range,5.0,3,2,2022,1,0,"Got the 128 GB model for 11k with coupon. Happy with the purchase. It's my first RealMe phone and I must say it has been a good beginning. I don't play many or heavy games but the few I play, the phone handles them well. Camera is excellent. Battery life above average. Fingerprint sensor okay. The UI is similar to Xiaomi phones, so moving to it is no problem. Not as sophisticated as MI but getting there. It uses standard Google apps (messages, dialer, files, etc) where it doesn't have it's own, which is a good thing. One can almost sense that the processor (Helio G85) is very reliable and capable. Nothing negative to say about the phone at all. Happy with my purchase."

56,Hitender Kumar Azad,Disappointed by the camera,2.0,22,12,2021,1,1,Narzo 50a disappointed me in term of its camera quality.. it even can't scan whatsapp QR code on computer... it does not look like 50 megapixel camera... its battery is superb as it has hd+ display its battery last for 2 days in moderate use.. in this price range you will get good camera phones.. try other options if you want a camera phone..
57,Khushi agrahari,Bad,1.0,23,1,2022,1,1,Not charging above 80per. And they claim for 1 year warranty  and I received this product today when I m claiming for repairing they says repairing is not available. I'm very disappointed from this purchase
58,ARPIT,Good phone not the best,5.0,28,11,2021,1,0,Battery is good video recording os average and camera is not up to the mark but i had required 128 gb mobile with speed touch mobile as i had realme 2 and it is easy to transfer all apps and msg even whatsapp msg from any realme to realme mobile overall i am happy as per my usage i got good discount on it in amazon diwali sale

62,atik ahmed jiva,Camera is worst,1.0,14,12,2021,1,1,This phone's canera is worst then my 2017 motorola.they say 50 megapixels.are you kidding me ? Every year they just increasing numbers of megapixels but not increasing quality of sensor of camera. Night mode is just a button in this phone not working at all all blck photos . And screen is also not smooth as well just glichty glichty display. üòì I regret that i spent 12k on this .
63,Yash Koshti,Battery life and Display,4.0,26,11,2021,1,0,"Battery life is really good, you don't need to see after it for 4-5 days.It's display, OMG! I haven't expected it to be this good. I was expecting a typical LCD screen but this is something different. You won't feel you are using something less than amoled display.Camera is also good but need some software optimizations and performance is also good.Touch sampling rate is really great, you can enjoy some Battle Royal or Action RPG with a smooth touch experience.If you have budget of 10k then this phone is highly recommendable."
64,Simanchal,No quick charge,3.0,23,10,2021,1,1,"Quick charging should be provided for this type of massive 6000 mAh battery, it takes 3.5 hours to get fully charged from 5 to 100%. It is a drawback of this phone. Camera (50 MP) is also not up to that mark, picture looks like oil paint. Message app is not good, it takes time to get loaded each time. Improvements to be done."
65,Pratikpanchal,Front camera result is not good as expected.,2.0,7,12,2021,1,0,Front camera result is not good as expected (not good) and body has some issue at charging area and card access location.when you touch it then you feel that here there is some very small space overe here. very small noice you will hear from there when you touch it.I found small defect in mobile. How could they released it foe customers? They inspected or not?They initially did quality checks or not?Don't know why!I want to replace this model with another. Amazon any suggestions.
66,Gauri,Poor phone,1.0,12,1,2022,1,1,Camera qualy is very bad similar to 12 mp camera phone.Performance is also slow. Very slow if compared to same phones of redmi/samsung.It seems they have just changed the phone model and everything is outdated.Amazon is promoting this phone which is very bad. Amazon should test the pl hone before promotion
67,Nambi Rajan WM,Beast in smart budget,5.0,11,12,2021,1,0,"Touch response is very fast, camera quality is best in day light, zoom has depth in 2x but looses sharpness in 5x. Processing speed is awesome and no lags, multi tasking is good, battery charging is fast and last couple of days, I am already using realme 2 pro for 3 years - still no issues encountered, keep up the quality as always REALME."
68,Amazon Customer,Good according to price (10k),2.0,30,10,2021,1,2,Everything is good according to price(after applying coupon and discounts).Screen is quite more sensitive than actually being).processor quite slow.Quite heavy weight.Everything is good according to budget (10k)
69,Sahil Vasudev,Good for non extensive users,4.0,22,12,2021,1,1,"I felt little lag while using the device. Overall it's good with good camera, battery life and even fast charging at this range"
70,Zohaib Ilyas,*Great!*,5.0,8,1,2022,1,0,"Performance, battery, camera, UI everything is awesome! There's just one thing that annoys me - they didn't include an ultrawide lens. Instead of those macro and depth sensors they could've opted for an ultrawide lens. Then it would've been dual camera setup but would've been better than *this* triple camera setup. In terms of gaming I played rocket league sideswipe at 60fps and I got almost no lag. The phone turned a lil bit warm but didn't become hot after playing. I like how they chose to go for stock android in many places. Overall a good budget phone."
