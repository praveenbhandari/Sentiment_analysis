¬†Another beauty from Apple. I was upgraded from iPhone X and it was great experience with all the latest specs and flawlessly smooth. Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip.Build quality was great as always from Apple.Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I‚Äôm happy with the blue colour  ‚Äú not bad at all and not too flashy‚ÄùGrip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient  as a normal user.If you are from iOS ecosystem nothing will go wrong here.There is nothing to question about the quality and interface from Apple ( it‚Äôs my personal opinion as a long time apple user)As you all know iPhone 12 won‚Äôt comes with earphones and charging brick( adapter)I bought separately 20w apple adapter from new Apple India online store for Rs.1900I don‚Äôt judge here apple because of accessories removal and the price tag. I hope apple can justify this.I only hope and wanted to see so badly Made in India IPhones so that we all can enjoy lower priced ( at least a better priced) iPhones in the future.A big thanks to Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd and Amazon for delivering genuine iPhone as always in perfect condition. Delivered way before the promised date.Update: (01/12/2020) After testing 25 days especially on battery life of this iPhone 12, results were amazing and I‚Äôm completely satisfied  with the battery performance. On Moderate gaming, Moderate Video Content, heavy on calls and heavy on browsing this iPhone 12 battery life is sufficient for your regular Day.My conclusion is definitely a better and improved battery performer than the previous iPhone model.Thank you Apple IndiaThank you Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.Thank you Amazon India.( Note: charger brick was shown in my video was bought myself from Apple India online store because it won‚Äôt comes with the phone)"
4,Anupam,This phone is a joke and the joke is on us!!! Don‚Äôt buy this phone.,1.0,7,1,2021,1,578,"Extremely disappointed with this phone. It‚Äôs a seemingly average phone which is over priced by 4 to 5 times at least. This phone is a joke in comparison with any Samsung flagship phone. I am shocked that so many fools like me are falling for apple‚Äôs trickery and gimmickry.The battery doesn‚Äôt last half a day. Screen size is average. Thickness of this phone will constantly remind you that this phone belongs to another era. 64gb space won‚Äôt be enough for anyone.And then there are other apple quirks - won‚Äôt come with a SD card, won‚Äôt come with a charging brick or a set of head phones. Your headphones with the regular audio pin won‚Äôt work with this one. Face ID won‚Äôt work with masks on. So your forced to remove your masks when you‚Äôre out and vulnerable. This phone won‚Äôt allow you set google maps as default. So you continue to suffer using their apple map which I bet even Tim Cook doesn‚Äôt use. You won‚Äôt be able to set google chrome as your default browser as iOS won‚Äôt let you.Overall the phone is overpriced and overrated. Anybody with half the wit will figure that this phone is a joke and a mere marketing gimmick. An ordinary phone like this shouldn‚Äôt cost you more than 12 to 14K.Apple is going down!Amazon won‚Äôt take this phone back as they have a 10 day return policy. So I am pretty much stuck with this damn excuse for a phone till I get to upgrade to a Samsung phone."
5,Paras,The Beast,5.0,13,11,2020,1,452,"This was my first switch to an ios device after using an android untill now. And I am not disappointed. The build quality, the responsive touch, the display, the camera, the battery life are just exceptional.Been using for about 10 days now, and consistently giving around 7h of screen on time.The camera is just way too good. Espeecially the night mode impressed me a lot.Only issue when switching from Android to iPhone I encountered was to be not able to restore my whatsapp chats. There are no official/free ways for doing this.The phone is simple amazing."
6,Debabrato Chakraborty,Don't Buy from Amazon,1.0,6,2,2021,1,354,If you are planning to buy an iphone then please buy from stores only.I got a defective product and when I complain about it to amazon customer care and requested for replacement they simply deny to replace it.Don't waste your money.
7,Elliot,Beastü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©,4.0,9,11,2020,1,283,"Hello there,I am writing this review after 3-4 days of usage, Iphone 12 is a beast in terms of:-MemoryBuild qualityCameraProcessorDisplayExcept battery there‚Äôs rumour going on that iPhone 12 battery is bad or worst, so i am here to clarify all your doubts,iPhone battery will last easily a day but not more than that and here‚Äôs some condition that you should aware about1. If you are using your phone on wifi than it will last a day easily without any problem.2. If you are on 4g than it will not last a day for example, if you fully charged your phone at 8 am than it will last till 8 pm not more than that and this happen if you‚Äôre on 4g continuously otherwise it will last about 10 pm.Here‚Äôs some tip you should do after buying iPhone 12, watch video on YouTube to know ‚ÄúHow to save battery on iPhone 12‚Äù this will help you increase your battery life as well battery health.For my experience, i think you should go for this device without any second thoughts & those who don‚Äôt have any tech knowledge and thinking of buying this then I recommend you to go for android because iOS has complicate settings than android...you will regret after buying it.Got original product Btw!!!!!"

9,RakhuNathan,Not Really worth the money,4.0,18,12,2020,1,184,"I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items.  But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.PROS : Camera & PerfomanceCONS : Battery and Cost"
10,Naman,"Activation Failed, this product was not recognized by Apple official website.",1.0,24,6,2021,1,145,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Bad experience! I have purchased Iphone from Amazon before as well but this time the activation of new iphone 12 failed when I was setting it up. I tried contacting Apple support but the serial number mentioned on the box was invalid. I really don't know if it is a counterfeit product or there is some technical issue but one thing is sure that Apple's Website is not recognising the IMEI and serial Number of new Iphone 12 I bought from here"
11,Mr. k  singh,"Performance is excellent,battery draining too fast and heating issue",4.0,7,11,2020,1,112,"I am writing this review after 40 days of use of iPhone 12. phone camera is excellent like DSLR ,very fast processor ,face ID feature looks great ,overall everything is fine but only issue which this phone has is , battery draining too fast. You can use 100% battery only for 5-6 hours of continuous use after that you have to charge it. Apple should look into this."
12,Good vegetable,How to decide between iPhone 11 and 12,4.0,24,12,2020,1,108,"After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ‚Çπ 84900. After credit card discount(‚Çπ6000), old phone exchange(‚Çπ3450) and reward points money(‚Çπ4530) inclusion, I bought it for ‚Çπ70920. There‚Äôs also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn‚Äôt let go of blue1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it‚Äôd cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn‚Äôt seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.2: DISPLAY: I‚Äôve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.How to choose between 64/128gb:If you‚Äôre not really tight on budget, I‚Äôd suggest to go for 128gb variant. I‚Äôve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage  occupied about 60gb. So it‚Äôd make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.CONS:1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price2. If you‚Äôre an android user, migration would be little time consumingUpdate: I‚Äôve uploaded a couple of pictures shot using automatic night mode. :)"
13,SWAPANKARMAKAR,Apparaio Retail & Amazon doing absolute frauds with customers,1.0,11,7,2021,1,76,I purchased new apple iphone12 with exchange of my samsung m31. from day1 while charging the body is conducting electricity .replaced chargers but still same issue. cross checked earthing of home-it is fine . then contacted apple support . they told me to get a replacement from the seller but amazon is just avoiding to replace. they asked emails proofs of case id of apple support. I provided them but still they are not assuring replacement . They sell defective products and do not replace. THIS IS DISGUSTING

16,Aashik Francis,Confused? Read on! One stop review for your flagship purchase.,5.0,4,8,2021,1,57,"I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I‚Äôve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive. If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021),  apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra.  If you read a few reviews you‚Äôll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues  and 9pro cameras didn‚Äôt live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand5. The haptics are spot onWhat‚Äôs Missing: (Minor misses though)1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you‚Äôll get used to it.2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensorWait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:It took a while for 12‚Äôs prices to fall.  If you‚Äôre willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.64GB or 128GB:The difference is around ‚Çπ6000.  64GB if you don‚Äôt play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128üòäBattery:I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to  it‚Äôs competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.Android Flagship Option:The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship. If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.Hope this review helped :)Update:13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch. That‚Äôs it. No more differences. Everything else remains the same.iPhone 13 launched at 80k which is lesser than 12‚Äôs launch price(86k).  If you want to save on some cash , 12 will still  do the job (12 is currently around 55k-62k).  However if you can spend that extra 20k, then 13 should be your pick.Planning on taking an Android? Definitely wait until early 2022."
17,Nihal lambe,No one can better do iphone is iphone,5.0,6,11,2020,1,76,Same like the old classic iphone 5 lookBut now difference is only6.1 inch display or The A 14 bionic chipAnd oled Hd display
18,Shreyas Zad,One beast of a phone.,5.0,8,11,2020,1,67,"I am writing this after a week of my usage with this iPhone 12. I have had the X before and OnePlus 6T as well.Overall experience of switching to iOS again is so good. The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.I‚Äôll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.Pros:1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.2. The speed, the performance.3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don‚Äôt usually need any professional touch.4. Battery life - I‚Äôll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don‚Äôt play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don‚Äôt believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.ConsNothing much until now.The back of the phone is fingerprint magnet, attracts a lot of them.Another concern was the charging adapter which is not provided in the box."
19,Sapana Konthoujam,Very poor service especially related to buying mobile,1.0,1,6,2021,1,72,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Dear Team,Please be informed that I am very dissatisfied by the services provided by Amazon buying this much expensive mobile from Amazon is not worth I believe they always provide us the defected item I recently purchased I phone 12 and it is creating a problem while switching on had to try multiple times for the same and this problem occurs every time whenever I switch off the mobile last time also the same issue occur when I bought my One plus 08 there was issue related to camera image was getting blurred each time and then I have to replace it I think Amazon just sell defected items I am very angry and wil take it forward because it's second time in a row and will never suggest any one to buy mobile especially from Amazon and also want to post the review about this on social media"
20,Anil V Oommen,iPhone 12 review,3.0,7,11,2020,1,53,"Positives: Very fast, Picture Quality, video quality seems superb,  less charging time required.Cons: Shorter battery life than specified and expected."
21,Sunil,Never buy expensive items from Amazon,1.0,8,8,2021,1,37,"Device is wonderful but never buy expensive items from Amazon, its better to purchase from Apple store.Delayed delivery by 3 days and on top of it no one in amazon knows where my device was. I have to perform multiple follow ups to enquire about my device and Amazon CSR is worst when it comes to logging a complaint.The final product received is having a dent and Amazon denied servicing and asked to check with Apple, Apple of-course denied since the product is purchased from third party e-commerce website.Lesson learned after 5 days of total frustration and being played as shuttlecock between Amazon and Apple, its better to spend few bucks more and purchase iPhone from Apple rather than typing this review with a dented device."
22,Sanjib M.,"READ before BUY ! ""Iphone 12! Worth buying or not?""",4.0,21,1,2021,1,40,"From owner POV, It's completely different experience for me as I've come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I'm lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.As per the limitations :1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it doesn't feel like one)2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name's not Sanjib 'Ambani' ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)Advantages:1. It's a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it's best in the market.2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)3. Display (Can't find much difference if you're a Samsung flagship user.)4. The design and in-hand feel.5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it's premium.Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.But iPhone 12 in 2020?  its a technological wonder. It's very slim, premium and beautiful.If you're comfortable to spend 80k, you should go for it for a wonderful experience."
23,Abhishek James,For first time iPhone Users,5.0,14,11,2020,1,38,"When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily."

27,Amit Kumar,What a Phone. Its iPhone,5.0,8,11,2020,1,34,"Its my First Apple device. Happy to own it after a long confusion between iPhone 11 and 12. I believe, it was worth waiting for 12.Received it on 04-Nov-2020. Working well till now. Checked Service Support Coverage. Its a genuine product.AndiPhone in white color is legend.Update after 1 month approx.-----------------------------------After using it for a month I am in love with this phone. Too smooth and I forgot what is lagging...Battery backup is very good and lasts one and half day easily with normal usage. I charge my phone when the battery is around 30%. Battery health is 100% after a month.Camera is awesome and gives very nicely detailed pictures with true colors.Phone speakers are really great and warm. They are loud but don't shout. Listening music or watching videos are enjoyable without earphones too.4G speed better than other 4g phones I have.Worth every penny."
28,Dipanjan Roychoudhary,Perfect replacement for a long time android user,5.0,4,12,2020,1,30,"Okay I NEED TO CLEAR a few misconceptions about this phone because i am seeing a lot of negative reviews here which are not true, probably from IOS haters. I have been an android user since 2014 when I got my first phone, after many years i switched to Apple after complaining about their high prices  because i was disappointed with Samsung using Exynos processors for their flagship phones in India which causes heating, and Oneplus throwing one cheap model after another every six months.And trust me guys its amazing. The software is butter smooth, i might never go back to android again.  FIRST OF ALL - who said the battery life is bad? I got my phone at 70 percent charge at 2 pm and after 24 hours it was 20 percent EVEN AFTER I KEPT MY DATA PACK ON THE WHOLE TIME.SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is  real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in androidand lastly - the AI is so sharp, be it the camera which automatically detects low light or even the face recognition.overall this phone is worth the high price. i will definitely be using it for 4-5 years. a happy customer here"

Phone is good but as comparing to picture quality most premium phones have better than this one.

33,rupinder,I miss my OnePlus 6,3.0,23,3,2021,1,24,"Android v/s iOSPro Apple1. Tons of privacy features and solid implementation. Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.And with a future update, facebook won't be able to track what you're doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud. 2. BatteryThe battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus can't touch this. If you bring this up with them, they'll distract you by saying it has fast charging.3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.4. Build Quality - SOLID.5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be ""raam bharose"", but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature won't work. Half baked implementation.Pro Android / Anti - iOS1. Notifications. Notifications centre on iPhone SUCKS. I have missed email notifications regularly. Android does this so well.2. Implementation of new app library feature sucks. This creates a very confusing situation. The way to solve this would be if the auto-folders in app library could be manually managed.3. Screen Sizes and Notch - The Notch is a disgrace for iphones when the iphones have reached the level of punch hole displays. Hoping the next year's model can make it better.4. No Truecaller in iPhone and no call recording. I can forgive the call recording considering the privacy first model, but truecaller is a pro to privacy.5. CHEAP QUALITY OF CHARGING CABLE. For a luxury brand, this is a disgrace.6. PRICE - Yes, iphones are expensive BUT, paying +10-15k for a phone available cheaper in Dubai / USA really pinches. Damn Taxes.7. Yes iPhones run smoothly but don't think that these don't stutter. I face very light stutters now and then and I restart at least once a week whenever I encounter it.I'll probably give this phone to my family member against their iPhone x since they're way too deep in ios ecosystem now."
34,Piyush Kumar,Phone is great but iOS sucks,3.0,23,7,2021,1,22,"First of all, I don't know why people here are leaving misleading reviews, I didn't feel any sort of heating issue or something like that, neither my phone is damaged nor it is refurbished. These sort of reviews are only making other people sceptical.Now let's talk about the cell phone itself.It is great, I love it. The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I have been an android user before this device and I am being honest right now :-iOS sucks in terms of user experience, Android is easy to use and makes a lot of sense (believe me, I was a hardcore android user, I didn't only use it for playing games and making calls). In iOS I kinda feel like being constraint.let me give you few example, which are quite obvious but still not in iOS:-1. Notifications- You can't reply through notifications.- Notifications from a similar user/ sender do bundle, but you can only see the latest message (You can't just swipe down on notification to preview the messages)- if you want to remove a particular notification then you have to swipe two times to the left. If you swiped right then it will open the message for you (lol).- Notifications are so huge, sometimes it's really painful to scroll through all the notifications.2. App library- It has something called app library, they thought it'd be cool to make one but by giving their own flavor. They bundled things in their respective folder not like in android where each icon represent an app. You have to explicitly click on search(app library) to see all apps in the list view or to search an app. Just copy android, no one is slapping you in the face for that.3. whatsapp- Using whatsapp is really frustating sometimes.- To send some media to a contact, there are three processes. Two times it will do preparing and then one time it will do the sending (finally). if you are sending some big media to someone then you can literally get a 15 min power nap and then grab a cup of coffee and drink it, still there might be chances that the iOS would be in one of the preparing process.- Sometimes when you click on someone's profile then instead of opening the user's profile, whatsapp tends to scroll to the location from where that current day chats are starting (I think that is whatsapp's issue not iOS)- You can't directly send any media as a document (preserving it's quality). There are steps to do that too.The above points are few examples, I will keep updating them as per my experience.I am not saying iOS is slow or the phone's hardware is bad, it's actually quite opposite of bad, it's fast and amazing.I just hated the user experience domain of iOS. It really really sucks. iOS should bluntly copy the android things so that the HARDCORE IPHONE USERS will know what user experience they were missing."
35,Harimuni,Worst Phone ever in my life,1.0,16,4,2021,1,21,Phone is heating up a lot while shooting a Video and playing a Game even very much difficult to hold such a hot. Some of the function not at all working like Call forwarding morning I have forwarded my call to other number and evening I am trying to turn it off but I am unable to enter into the function at all it rotating from past 2 Hours. Please I recommend not to purchase this Phone at all. It is totally a waste of money. Even security features like face unlock is automatically getting canceled out.

38,moazzam sameer,Decent buy.,5.0,14,11,2020,1,19,"Really happy with the purchase. But 2x zoom missing does make a little difference. Performance, Display, camera and battery are on point and that what matters the most to me. I was planning on buying the pro model but this year it was insanely expensive. So Bought this and saved some money for decent accessories. The value for money is great for the 128gb version."
39,Ranit Kumar Dholey,Long Term Review: Excellent All Rounder Device,5.0,27,9,2021,1,30,"This is going to be a long review, sit back, relax and have a read.I bought the iPhone 12 in May of 2021 after selling my OnePlus.Having used the iPhone7 and XR for years, this was my third iPhone.I have to say the iOS experience on the XR was absolutely horrible. Terrible reception, average battery and mediocre cameras forced me to move to android. I was tempted to move the 12 for all the improvements in modems, screen and the camera.And boy was I surprised . Let‚Äôs take up the review in sections.1. Screen: Having used a high refresh rate screen of OP8 before, I was quite sceptical about the 60hz of iPhone12 before I bought it. But, astonishingly, the iPhone12 screen is buttery smooth, courtesy of the high touch sampling rate and excellent animations. This does not feel like a 60hz display, and I cannot stress this enough. The display is EXCELLENT .2. Camera: being a photographer who has spent half of his life travelling, I prioritise a good camera over anything else. And these are surely the most spectacular cameras that I have used on a smartphone. Excellent HDR, great details and very post processing friendly. Of course, the video is as good as it gets on a phone. Attaching some images I shot on the 12 for your reference. Trust me when I say this, you could use this for some semi professional shoot just fine, if it‚Äôs only for social media and you are not printing really big.3. Battery: Battery on this device is not spectacular, it‚Äôs average. It will get you through the day for sure, unless you are in very long video calls two three times a day. It is good enough, on par with my OnePlus.4. Build Quality: this is where it is head and shoulders above the competition. Rock solid, an led weirdly lightweight, this feels very, very premium.5. Software: iOS 14 and the iOS15 have really pushed the sub par experience of ios11 away, and this software now feels smoother than ever. Great improvements. Excellent software experience, not something I could say with my XR.Summary: Excellent device, with no complains. This could really be one of the first devices that I used which I can call perfect. Highly recommended."
40,Integrity Packaging LLP,"Unmatched Quality, Simple & Powerful",5.0,16,7,2021,1,15,"The overall feel of the iPhone is very good. The weight of the phone is light & comfortable & size too for daily use. The screen, colours & image quality is unmatched. The colors on camera & photo are natural. Fingerprint reading & facial recognition is superb & very quick & highly accurate."
41,Balagangadhar P,"Worst Camera, Performance is not that fast",1.0,26,12,2020,1,17,"Worst camera and graphics if you compare pubg in oneplus mobiles and this phone, this phone‚Äôs graphics was worst like oppo phone graphics.

42,Arun,Selling defective pieces during sale!!,1.0,18,1,2022,1,11,"Bought an iPhone 12 during ongoing freedom sale and I received a defective piece as the phone has tiny dents around the charging port. I tried returning it but there‚Äôs no option to replace or return.  Don‚Äôt know what to do, stuck with it after spending 62 K."
43,Asutosh padhy,Absolutely loved the phone but price could have been bit cheaper,4.0,1,2,2022,1,9,"I phone i must say having great optimization of software with hardware, more quality apps are available when compared to google, receiving a file is the only major pain i felt till now,Battery backup is really good 2800 mAh in apple is almost like 5000mAh in android am not kidding, i have rog phone 3 it is 6000 mAh but at the end of the day the i phone has almost same % left, may be it's due to the less hz display.Despite of having 60Hz display it feels goodAnd what can i say the speakers are loud and clear compared with rog 3.45k should have been the right price for 64gb model but for 53k it's not a bad deal either, if you ask me spending 50k for an android is not worth since i phone has all hardware and software superiority.No charger is a big let down by apple. And finally 64gb is good enough if you ask me as most of those having wifi connection can easily upgrade to i cloud paying just 75rs/Month and for the average 3 years of use the price will be still 2700rs in three year. For the 128gb i had to pay 8000rs more so still i am saving around 5300rs if i chose to use i cloud from the starting day.No Finger print sensor , but it's ok the face id does it right but yes the finger print should be good. And for the notch it's ok. I phone 12 and 13 has virtually no difference so y to waste 20k more money buying the 13 jusy for the bit improvement of camera and brightness, hope you like me review üôÇ"
44,Praveen Palkhade,Sent me Faulty Rear Camera Iphone 12,1.0,5,8,2021,1,11,"Worst camera quality, want my money refund but Apple denied to refund and amazon asking to go Apple service center to have deny later from Apple. If you are planning to buy an iphone then please buy from stores only if you want genuine one. I got a defective product from seller. And After paying my hard earned money iphone says thats not their responsibility third class service centers, don't care customers time."
45,Dhaval Doshi,WHAT an upgrade from iPhone 8! Feels amazing in the hand! Like a bar of glass!,5.0,24,11,2020,1,12,Great battery life. Love the white colour. Blue is super hyped. It is a finger print magnet.There‚Äôs something about the design of these phones. No android phone can match the aesthetics. Except some curved display screens.Upgraded from iPhone 8. I am very very happy.Wish it was a bit cheaper. Bought with 6k instant hdfc discount and 6 months no cost emi.128gb.
46,Amazon Customer,Smart option compared to pro model,5.0,7,12,2020,1,10,"Upgraded for iPhone XR. Battery lasts almost the same as XR but iPhone adapts as per usage over time so it will take time. Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone. If a telephoto photography doesn‚Äôt seem to be on your agenda then this is a smart choice over the pro model."
47,alam sethi,Defective phone recieved,1.0,4,6,2021,1,11,"I received the phone with a crack on its screen which was apparently not visible to a naked eye.But this crack started to increase in size and became more visible after few days when the phone started heating. Now Amazon has taken there hands out of this matter and neither apple is helping me, furthermore they are asking me to get my screen replaced which will cost me ‚Çπ26500. So I request everyone to not buy there  phones  from Amazon."
48,Sahil Upadhyay,DON'T BUY HERE,1.0,9,6,2021,1,10,I got this phone on 4th May. And something was wrong with this phone. Also my brother bought the same phone but from a store. And that's working perfectly.Also apple gives 14 day return policy on each apple product but they closed my return window in 6 daysI started facing battery issues after few days. Phone was charging from 0-100% in about half an hour and same with the discharge.It went from 100 to 46% in 15 minutes and sometimes sudden shutdowns. I visited service centres and still my issues have not been resolved.I tried amazon support to help me but nothing happened and still the device is not in well condition and I can't use it.I had already checked that my product is genuine by filling all the details at apple website.But something is wrong either from amazon or apple.I can recommend if you are buying this device buy it a from a genuine store.In order to save 2-3k I made a mistake I guess.

50,palani,Beware of exchange,1.0,20,8,2021,1,8,"My existing iPhone was not exchanged and the reasons too weren't cited. The existing phones were in good condition. I dare Amazon to give me the reasons for not exchanging it if they have one. So don't fall for the exchange pray, appears to be a ploy. My umpteen emails to Amazon customer service on this topic was unanswered and finally upon escalation, the Executive CS team wrote back stating that the reasons for exchange can't be shared as it's an internal communication of theirs. Quite absurd! I quote below the etracts of their email dated 25th Aug 2021... Quote: I've reviewed your concern and see that our customer service team was able to address your issue concerning your exchange being denied. We are unable to provide internal information about the reason for exchanges being denied. Unquote:Now that's a complete surprise to a customer... If my phone doesn't gets exchanged, as customers I need to know the reasons too.. denial by Amazon to give a reason implies here that the exchange options are a gimmick to lure in customers to buy Phones on their online store.. Definitely, never expected Amazon to behave in this manner. Asides, Amazon CS took conveniently more than 2 weeks to respond to my emails and when they have responded the return window too is closed!!! Sad :("
51,kunal dhaked,Want replacement,1.0,19,7,2021,1,9,The phone worked fine for 10 days after that the phone started heating and after that the charging was slow and now its 1month and the phone's speaker is not working .. i have given 84000 for this product to your company and i have called ur support system but they have told me to go to apple service center..I have taken the phone today and they have told me that it will take 7 days to fix it .. but my point is that i want a new phone or i want my money back as i m not 1% satisfied with ur product and customer service so plzz dnt put ur company name down and provide me a new phone if the phone dosent satisfy me after the phone is returned to me by the apple service center . Or else i will go to consumer court .. plzz call me as soon as possible and provide me a proper reply and if i dont get any solution that is good to me then i will file an case in the consumer court .

This is my first ios device , The most i liked about this iphone is the inhand feel light weight,compact boxy design helps easy to hold the fone. When i was planned to switch from android to ios most of my frds told that battery life is a minus in iphones, but frankly i tell that the battery life effortlessly lasts for one complete day.Camera, display,sounds are awsome.

( Though I am not sure but as I said there is no newness also battery backup was real poor, I still remember when I bought one plus 5T it's battery lasted for atleast 2-3 days without any recharging but this product that delivered to me either it is not authentic or I have received defective one. Obviously seller won't return the item so u have to visit store to sort out your problems with phone. I hate it."
57,prajith kj,My worst mistake is to buy this product online,1.0,8,2,2022,1,5,"I am writing this, so nobody else end up in my situation. Bought a brand new iphone 12 from amazon for republic day sale. The product was defective , storage issues were there. System data itself was consuming 50 gb of total space so my phone was immediately full.Called Amazon support as it was within replacement period, they asked for a service denial report from apple service centre. When I checked with the service centre they informed apple never shares a service denial letter . And by my logic it was reasonable as how can apple deny service for their own product under warranty. Anyways amazon was useless , no support provided stating some strange reasons (service denial letter) !!Took this to apple service centre (iplanet vr mall bangalore) they kept my phone for 14 days doing nothing. They confirmed the phone is defective at the first place but was not able to support as it is a software glitch. They want me to escalate it through apple support only. Irony is I submitted it in service centre as per the suggestion by apple online support.At the end I am in a clueless situation not getting to know what to do with this product after spending 62000 INR. I suggest NOBODY to buy any apple product from amazon even if it looks so tempting with discounts and sales. Please dont fall pray for this trap."
58,vishnu,Touch screen stoped working in 5 days of purchase,1.0,10,6,2021,1,7,I bought this iPhone 12 128 GB after  3 days slowly letter b stoped working on keyboard I thought it was software glitch as sometime updateing software would solve the issue as we are in a pandamic situation I moved to my village where there little reception so update took 2 to 3 days to download. But even after updating there was no improvement so called apple support spoke to then at length about my situation and after hearing me they did some troubleshooting and came to a conclusion that it has some hardware problem and should approach Amazon as they were responsible for selling me this product for replacement.  by this time 7 days completed and according to the Amazon policy they only return and replace for 7 days.  When spoke to Amazon customer care they just wouldn't connect me to the concern department they just bluntly say I should approach apple but apple executive tells me he can't do anything. Is this how you treat a loyal customer you can check my account the and frequency I order trough Amazon. Not even connecting call to the concern department.
59,Chronos,iPhone 12 screen is a major bummer!!,3.0,13,2,2021,1,6,It‚Äôs such a disappointment. I have been using iPhone since it‚Äôs first version.So naturally upgraded from iPhone X to 12. But the excitement quickly died down as soon as I saw the screen. There is a warm greenish tint to it which makes the colors off.Selfie portraits aren‚Äôt good either. Too sharp for portraits. May be I should have gone for the 12 Pro Max as it handles much better because of the telephoto lens.Hope apple fixes the screen issues soon
60,Naval Kumar,"Over heating, freezing to death",1.0,9,5,2021,1,6,"Phone is good and it fits really well in hand. Only problem I have found in iPhone 12 is overheating and this started from the moment I have unboxed it. I have tried to contact Apple and Amazon but no one is agree to help me fix this heating issue or replace it.freezing to death all within 6 months and best part there is no after sales support either by Apple or Amazon.Kind of service I have received from Apple, I think this is my first and last iPhone, second apple product and last.It's better to get it from other platform or get it from store, Amazon does not provide any after sales support for iPhone 12.Overall horrible service from giants organization like, Apple and Amazon."
61,Dhruv,The iPhone (again) with an OLED display,5.0,15,3,2022,1,3,"While the iPhone 11 is an amazing device, without doubt, yet it has an IPS display. Older iPhone X and iPhone XS had OLED displays. Apple returned to OLED again with iPhone 12, although the refresh rate is at 60Hz. For those, who have not used devices with 90Hz or 120Hz, you would not notice any differences. Moving from an older iPhone with IPS display to iPhone 12, and you would immediately notice the crisp blacks. Battery size physically is less than the iPhone 11, yet Apple tweaks the A14 Bionic coupled with the iOS, which easily stretches the charge for 10-12hrs. on regular usage. Those heavily into web browsing, gaming etc. may not have such a long run with a single charge, yet it is capable enough for a pretty long day, without the need to plug in to the outlet. Oh, and yes, iPhone 12 comes with a USB-C to Lightning cable, but no charger. You will need to get a USB-C charger separately, either from Apple or other brands. Else, you can use your Qi charger, if you have one already.iPhone 12 also has a more boxy look, a throwback to the iconic iPhone 4 days. Overall, as with any Apple phone, it is an amazing device, if you use your smartphone for all the regular usage like apps, gaming, web browsing. And yes, it can send messages. Oh, forgot, it can make and receive calls too, quite well!"

Clearly not worth it. Apart from the 12mp ultra wide camera nothing else is impressive in this comparing to my old phone.  Updated to the latest iOS version. Running in low power mode.

The reason I am saying this is because this phone lacks even the most basic features that even a 5k android phone has, like - call recording - which I eventually realised that it should have been an Apple feature instead of third party apps - which demand money and are pretty inconvenient to use.The second drawback is that call logs are auto erased and kept up to a certain stack size (100 / 102) and if you want to go back to pull any earlier call logs beyond this specified stack size, you won‚Äôt be able to do so and will have to rely on your network provider (if you are eligible) for the same.These are two very ground level use cases that fail to deliver in an Apple device and since I faced real life situations surrounding these two scenarios I feel that I it is not worth having this Phone and better to keep your ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù pants on.Then I thought why I bought this phone in the first place and got my answer - 1. Camera ??Android phones are easily  competing nicely with iPhone Camera now-a-days and some have even better camera.2. Brand marketing / re-selling value / durability ?? I am so over it now after 8 months of usage and the price keeps on sinking down as newer model enters the market so not a wise call I must sayFinal outcome:Definitely not a returning customer."
73,Arnab,Great software seamlessly working with awesome hardware.,5.0,20,12,2020,1,6,"The hardware- cameras, spatial audio system, built and chip- are really really good. Better than any other high end phone in the market.The iOS software is really awesome! With features like shortcuts, siri among others- this phone is the smartest smart phone in the market. It just does things for you in the background to give you the unique user experience that android has not been able to give so far. I switched from an android phone (OnePlus) to this and it has been a very refreshing and wonderful change."
74,Junaid Masoodi,A good uograde,5.0,9,11,2020,1,9,"Overall it looks good, coming from XR it looks a good upgrade for me. Design is ‚Äòback to basics‚Äô which is compelling. I loved the fast response among other things."
75,Lav,Great purchase!,4.0,30,12,2020,1,3,"I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.INR 3000‚Çπ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000‚Çπ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000‚Çπ. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn't included and it coasted 1900‚Çπ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.Overall it's a great device and satisfied purchase but overpriced for sure."

This is a perfect phone ever with awesome battery life (I use it very much still one and half day chal jata he) speed is mind blowing and camera just wowwww!!!

77,Amesh Gharat,Overall good phone with some minor setbacks.,4.0,25,3,2021,1,4,"Overall good phone as it feels very premium, being made with high quality materials and has great performance. Excellent camera quality, great design and screen quality. The A14 processor is super fast and the phone never heats up even while performing intensive tasks. The speakers are very loud and clear and give out high quality sound.One problem I encountered is that  the battery life is not great but definitely above average. Another issue is the notch which makes the phone look outdated especially in 2021. The Face ID is also not useful while wearing masks which causes a lot of inconvenience since the phone doesn‚Äôt have a fingerprint scanner. The phone is also limited to a 60Hz refresh rate which again makes it less compelling than the competition which makes phones with 120Hz refresh rate at a much lower price."

79,s3r,Best selling phone in the world!!!,4.0,1,6,2021,1,2,"No wonder Apple makes some of the best phones in the world. Iphone 12 deservedly is the highest selling phone.I was upgrading from iphone 7 which served me well for 4 years, which I exchanged for this.The delivery & exchange formalities were smooth.The phone itself is surely an upgrade when compared to 7, the display is top notch, the camera is probably the best there is, the face unlock works like a charm, what's to say about the best phone, it works even better than advertised.The only problem like always is the battery which hardly lasts a day & charging time is also an issue, it tends to heat up a little while charging but with the previous experience with iphone 7, the longevity of the phone is guaranteed with the timely updates from Apple, the premium which an iphone demands stands justified with a superior product.Some people tried to discourage me from buying an iphone from Amazon claiming warranty & support issues. But there's no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it's as advertised.Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it's prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty. Do remember to do this within 3 months of your purchase."
80,Raghuvaran N,It's a refurbished phone,1.0,27,1,2022,1,5,The phone already had a profile when I opened the settings. This is a refurbished phone. I logged in with my apple ID only to find another person has already been using this phone. This is clearly a refurbished item being sold as new. Please stop this cheating and refund my purchase.
81,Jamadagni,Huge leap for the standard iPhone,5.0,22,2,2021,1,5,"Upgraded from an iPhone 7 32 gigs to iPhone 12 . After holding out for a long time the upgrade was worth it. All the feature set display, camera, speakers, signal reception, chipset is a huge upgrade. Recommended if you happen to have a device from 2016 or older. This device will be the new standard iPhone for the next 4 years. So worth it if you get it now."

¬†Phone is awesome no doubt camera also as expected Smooth phoneBut There is no adaptor charger iphone provide only data cable people spend 85k and then again spend for 2k for charger that is very inappropriate this is not good people will not buy if this will continue providing not charger. What‚Äôs the meaning of phone people buy phone and don‚Äôt have charger to charge the phone first experience is mine for iphone is very bad because of charger. Because new c type adaptor is not getting everywhere how people will charge his phone. 85000 is a big amount so thing about it and provide full sets of charger."

Earlier I was using oneplus 6T and after malfunction of the screen, i decided to move to Iphone. Before buying i had done all the R&D. Many of reviews says that it has bad battery life and couldn't stand a day. But as per my usages my battery stays all day long. I used to make call (6 to 7 hours), video, music, surfing everything except game and battery last upto 24 hours with data mode on.In my opinion its worth buying."

88,Vignesh Bhasker,I prefer the 11 or the 12 mini,3.0,1,6,2021,1,5,"I have been an apple user for the past 10 years and this is the first phone which is disappointing. I was using the Xr and 11 before this and though of upgrading.1. If you are moving from an android to iPhone for the 1st time, its a great phone to get in terms of camera, processor, screen quality. But if you are already an existing iPhone user, upgrade only from XR downwards. That is if your are upgrading from a 8/X/XS/XR. If you have a 11, stick to it. Wait for the 13 or budget is not a constraint then get the 12 pro.2. form factor. Apple has gone back to rectangle brick design that they used in their earlier phones. Now for me this was one the reasons I didn't like the phone. It wasn't comfortable n the hand after being used to the curve of the X and 11 and XR3. Camera- best camera quality with night mode . u can't go wrong with this camera setup.4. screen- excellent screen quality , no complaints here.5. 5g - IS it really that big a deal breaker ? especially if you are in India where 5g seems a long way off.6. No charging adapter. You either have to connect it to your MacBook or buy a separate power adapter. When ur spending 70 odd grand, that's the least apple could offer.7. again no ear phones.8. It somehow doesn't have the wow factor as what the X had.Update.I exchange my phone for a 12 mini. much more easier to use with one hand and comfortable."

92,Saptarshi Dutt,"Excellent phone, beautiful colour‚ô•Ô∏è",4.0,3,4,2021,1,2,"Excellent phone, only reason I have reduced one star is since Amazon reduced the price by Rs 3000 the day after I received the phone and this really hurts after spending so much of my hard earned money. Exchange value received for my older phone was also pretty inadequate, considering the condition it was in.Pros:1. The green colour is gorgeous2. Cameras are outstanding3. Battery life is really good, lasts me almost 2 days on a charge4. Screen is very bright and has vibrant colours5. Speaker is very loudCons:1. Just nitpicking, but a fingerprint sensor would have been much more convenient during Covid2. Indian variant doesn't have the mmWave antenna, inspite of being more expensive than the US VariantOverall, a great buy.TIP: Please do not buy 64 GB model, unless you have a robust cloud subscription to upload stuff into."

I occasionally use my phones for browsing purposes. Charged to 100% on one evening and switched off for 25 hrs due to fever. After 25 hrs, when I switched on my mobile, the battery is 56%. I am wondering how can I fix it. Disabled all background refresh for apps and did as much as possible to improve the battery life. But no use.  I regret to buy this defective product from Apple/amazon"

96,...who else,Moving from Android to iOS?,4.0,2,4,2021,1,1,"Yes, it is a 5 star phone. But if you are moving from android to iPhone please be ready to lose your freedom. There is a lot available on internet to tell you about what you will lose out on. It is like speaking a new language altogether.Quick image editing, video editing, simple things like making collages, setting custom ringtones, quick editing of alarms, changing WiFi or Bluetooth, toggling location, many more basic features are either absent in iOS or managed in a very cumbersome way. You will miss them if moving from Andriod. Also be ready to lose your WhatsApp chat history. Not impressed by the sound reproduction on bigger speakers via Bluetooth and the very inflexible equilizer.For some silly reasons Apple is being stubborn on some aspects like standardisation of charging cable even within its own products. The notch at the top of the screen is still the same size it was in 2018.Rest, there are tons of reviews to praise the phone and I agree with most of them.Was a bit disappointed the way it was packaged. No foam or bubble wrap."

The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It‚Äôs top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price.For the price apple should have provided a charging brick and earphones, but they have not. Currently Amazon is selling this phone for 73k which is the best deal. Go for it."

There is a screen in the front with apple logo at the back, A top notch bazzle visible from miles, battery might not run for a day, but people do still admire the dead iphone which is great thing to be part of, other than this sound quality is better, camera awesome, full pack of connectivity issues, you will be able to know how capable you are to find the solutions."

So, In 15 mins, you are having half the battery up. Love the border outlay of this beauty. It‚Äôs almost a month of usage and I can boldly say, ‚ÄúThe best switch one can make‚Äù. I know the price tag is always hefty but then you are choosing a long term reliability. Kudos to Apple Inc and Amazon for amazing delivery in 2 days.*Please avoid playing Apple Arcade games as they would drain you battery like anything. In my best guess, It is not rightly optimised for it.*What I come to see is why Apple looked for environmental protection by removing charger and earphones. I guess it should come at a reasonable price then. It really put me off but then you know what the market player is serving."

However keeping this aside, I would try to genuinely help those looking for reviews before buying, in a few simple steps.1. Go for it if you are going for an upgrade after  3-4 years, as it will give you some flawless experience again.2. Battery life is not upto the mark, I feel XR that I used before this had a good battery, maybe I am wrong.3. Face ID has got no significant improvement at all, again I think XR had a better face detection.4. Camera I could sense something has been done.5.

It's smooth and quick, and it doesn't become hot when in use or charging. The charge lasts the entire day (I use it mostly for social media, web browsing and music) Face recognition is excellent. Battery health is 100% (check this when you receive your phone under ‚Äòbattery health' in settings) and to keep it that way, make sure you close all background apps while the phone is not in use. Play a ‚Äòpixel test 4K' video on YouTube to see if your phone monitor has any dead pixels. I use the original Apple adaptor (which must be purchased separately) and the type C cable that comes in the box. Overall the phone is a great purchase!"
141,BHARADWAJ,Value for money at that price,5.0,25,6,2021,1,2,Excellent product and value for money at that price way better than one plus pro 5g at that price because iphone 12 supprts all the band's of 5G and camera screen are as usual excellent privacy always built-in for apple products üëç

Since apple user since many years, it was time to upgrade from iphone 7 to iphone 12, 256 GB config. Didn't find much difference in 13 and 12, so the price I got for 12 was decent balance for the upgrade. Feature wise I miss fingerprint scanner compared to previous version.

147,Vishal Anand,The BOSS Phone..!!! iPhone 12 truly a masterpiece from Apple.,5.0,21,6,2021,1,1,"I am writing this review after using my iPhone 12 for three weeks and I must say the decision I took to switch from android(I have been an android user for the last 8years xD xD) to iOS has been incredible. The experience is commendable, iPhone 12 is the best phone in the market as of now.  I haven‚Äôt faced any battery issue or any heating issues as I have seen other reviews complaining the battery and heating of the iPhone. Attached are a few sample shots I took from my iPhone to show that the Apple‚Äôs camera quality is unmatched and surreal.  The Face unlock is great, the battery‚Äôs pretty good, camera‚Äôs excellent‚Ä¶.overalls my whole transition from android to iOS has been great. Go for this phone guysss‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs the best in the segment with some mind blowing iOS features. P.S. Just got updated to iOS 14.6 üòäüòäüòä"
148,Bhavya,Must Try | Over Priced,5.0,22,7,2021,1,1,"This is the first IOS device for me after using an android until now. No doubt the transition was smooth. The camera is superb. It has FLAGSHIP LEVEL CAMERA. I need to charge it once for full day usage(not an heavy user) while using internet. OLED display is superb. Being an Android user since start, I was not able to restore my Whatsapp data in IOS which was one of the drawbacks. Overall it is good phone but overpriced. You won't get charger and earphones. There is a challenge to try new apps as most of the apps in IOS are paid  with just 3-7 days trial period. There are other brands in market who provides similar features at very less cost but at the end it's IOS vs Android."
149,sk,Great phone. Prices in India not so great,4.0,11,8,2021,1,0,Battery life is good. Great display. Point and shoot is always good on iphones. Phone has all that you need.Prices is always high and we still buy like fools and to top it we dont get earphones nor the power brick.The last thing is we do not get quality military standard drop protective cases which is the worst thing its nothing related to phone but good to know info. Even if you get they are some of the worst ones and price is atleast three time more compared to the original product price.And if your buying Apple warranty you will keep draining your money as they have the worst support. They only believe in replacements and I am sure its not worth it to pay 18k for an year.
150,Glamour123,The phone is a beast!,5.0,22,12,2020,1,1,"Thanks to Amazon n the seller for early delivery. I have used this phone from the last 10 days n it‚Äôs absolutely stunning, beautiful n the beast..Camera is awesome n the night mode is fabulous. I have upgraded from iPhone 6s. No other phone in the current market can outdo it. Though it‚Äôs expensive but you won‚Äôt regret to buy if u can afford.I have seen a lot of other negative comments n they r android users. I will be using this ph for another 5 to 6 years."
151,phalguna mattangi,Kind of disappointed on battery health and during camera usage,3.0,4,8,2021,1,0,"Well this is iphone but for me it‚Äôs another phone. Battery backup is one issue when you continually use it for couple of hours like imovie, camera or editing apps. Battery health got depleted to 91% and not sure I don‚Äôt game or edit things every day. This should be a beast on multitasking but yeah it is what it is. I‚Äôm gonna sell this one sometime. Even there are recommendations to use genuine products but it‚Äôs kind of overrated. Apple should seriously work on this battery part."

159,Hari Narayan,Perfect if this is what you want,5.0,11,2,2022,1,0,"What I Liked.1) Weight Balancing2) Battery Optimisation3) Software update upon unboxing4) Camera and Security featuresWhat I didn't like1) Limitations of common Charger. I have to use different charging cables for my iPhone, while my iPad Pro, Samsung Buds etc share a USB C cable.2) Some advertised features require the support of additional devices of Apple Eco System. For example, Apple said with iOS 15.3 face ID will work even with Masks On. But I just learned that this feature works only if you have an iWatch also.3) Not a gamer, but still for this price point at least a 90Hz refresh was desirable.4) Front Camera, sometimes have not of noise (nitpicking)At the end of the day, I am happy with my purchase. But I strongly recommend this phones to enthusiasts and upgraders only."

Upgraded from iphone XR. Trust me guys no any android phone beats iphone in any class. Super feeling to hold, compact Size, premium look. If u are looking for overall beast for moderate to heavy usage go for it without any hesitation. I think price dropped more in future beacause now chip will be made in indian apple factory. I you not use iphone before purchase it then u will see the power of iphone. Only thing u will disappointed with the battery. It will last only 5-6 hrs of moderate use. Using fast charger will reduce the pblm slightly but need for improvement."

168,Pallavi Katyal,Bad customer support and no support on replacement of defective product received .,1.0,25,1,2022,1,0,"I ordered iphone 12 blue,128gb started showing issues. It was getting restarted on its own after every 15 mins or so. The display started lagging and and at times the device was completely unresponsive leading to unexpected shutdowns all this happened in merely 5 days of using it. And upon contacting customer support I was informed by Ms. Tuleshwari from support team to connect with Brand and in case the brand is ready to issue a service report they will initiate the replacement request. Upon getting the service report done from Apple service centre the support team staff Mr. Sanjay on outright basis denied replacment stating we cant issue basis the report. It's the brand who will have to be contacted. Customer service and support is clearly lacking with a brand like Amazon. What's the point of claiming of a free 7 day replacement policy when the support team clearly twists it as per their own convenience. I have had a experience of lifetime and would highly recommend no one to buy from Amazon. They are best at not helping consumers whatsover.  #patheticpolicies #poorcustomerservice"

Since I am not a fan of too much customization so for me this UI is totally fine. Plus gaming experience was also good till now I played nfs no limit and it works like a champ. I also really like it's ram working since my app in background keeps running without always reloading it when again opened.One last since I haven't used 120 Hz refresh rate so I can‚Äôt tell about it but since my old phone was also no having it so for me it's awesomeüëå.Camera is also awesome till now I haven't used it much due to covid but in low light it worked too good no doubt about it:).Hope this will help someoneüòÅ

From service centre they told me that in this model it‚Äôs a known issue. Though they will fix this free of cost as it is under warranty period but still why should I use a repaired handset.
237,Sujan koilakuntla,Regret my costlier purchase,3.0,21,7,2021,1,0,My old Poco F1(15k) is much better in all aspects. Iphones are just for show off. Battery life sucks.

A great buy. Delivery by Amazone was good got it on fourth day even in this lockdown time. Face unlock works like a charm when you are not using mask.
