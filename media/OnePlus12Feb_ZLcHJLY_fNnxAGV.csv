1,Naveen Jha,Waste of hard earned money - buy only if you want to thow your money to buy a bin,1.0,28,7,2021,1,"3,513",In my first review given within 24 hrs l found it amazing but after 10 days of usage l can say it is full of bugs; l checked my return window it passed on 3rd Aug ; l regret to choose one plus over samsung.. sooner l have to exchange or throw this mobile if bugs not fixed.One plus no never purchase; frustrated with this mobile.
2,RAVI RANJAN,Just go for it!,5.0,28,7,2021,1,"3,325","First of all I would like to tell you that i won't be giving a very technical review like those on ytube videos. I am gonna give a very honest review as a general phone user just like all of you only. This is my first phone for a price above 20k so i thought and researched a lot before buying. I was confused between buying iphone 12 and Nord 2 I know the price difference is more but still I won't go for above 50k to buy any phone other than Iphone. But honestly man i think at 30k this 1+ nord 2 is really astonishing. You don't need to go for one plus 9 or other higher range phones of one plus or else if you have some extra bucks in pocket which u just wanna spend.So I will be telling u the pros and cons of this phone very honestly after 3-4 days of very vigorous usage.Pros:1. Very ultra premium features at this price range of 30k and pretty much matching features with higer range one plus models.2. The display is just great.3. Screen refresh rate you can actually feel to be fast @90Hz.4. No heating issue in phone or the charger till now.5. They are giving a back cover with the phone, which is pretty good actually with bumps in side and camera portion which actually saved my phone from a direct fall on a rough floor that too on screen side..and no scratches at all!!..so the cover's tested guys😂and it actually feels elegant. So you need not do the hectic work of searching for back covers after buying a phone and infact the scratch guard which they have put on the screen is quite handy.. I don't think u need to put a temper guard if u handle ur phone well, anyways thats your choice..for me i m gonna go with the scratch guard for some weeks or may be month n lets see how it goes..for now about a week it feels to be performing just outstanding.So i wont be telling u more features of this phone as u can read'em anywhere in its specifications.I will tell you some 'X-Factors of Nord 2. And why you should decide to buy this phone1. The charging time.. I was like whtt!! When the phone shootes up from 0% to 85% in just about 30mins and upto 100% in around 40-45 mins...So the warp charging is just out of world @65W charger. Never ever saw this in any phone.2. The stereo speakers. When i played the first song i was just shocked what i just heard. Yes it actually feels to be giving a 3D feel of sound. Actually sound comes out of speakers on bottom right as well as speakers on top of screen which are meant to be for calling purpose only in other phones .So this phone just rocked here. 3. The camera just performs outstanding in low light, dark or even very dark sorroundings.To check it I went on to my terrace and clicked a picture in dark which you can see yourself..i have put it here. 4. The phone buid really feels premium.Some of the cons or I won't say cons..bcz I don't really feel them as cons.as u can ignore them over the astonishing features of this phone..but since we can't go away without mentioning some cons so here are some.1. They could have provided a little higher battery capacity like those in Samsung phones coz of Such a high resolution display and refresh rate..but it could have increased the weight of phone..so its pretty much understandable.Battery back up is some what 12-14 hrs which I got on continuous usage..like songs.. attending meetings on teams.. Netflix etc. But since it gives so..so..so.. fast charging u just wont feel it.2. No earphone jack..If that is a con to u..not for me actually😂 Nothing else serious issue this phone has got me into till now .So that it guys..If i find anything else after prolonged Usage I will honestly put it here.So I will say if you wanna buy a phone above 50k just dont..buy this if you budget is ~25k stretch it a lill and buy this Nord 2."
3,Harsimran,"Initial thoughts- A good, practical phone",4.0,28,7,2021,1,"1,657","Received my unit 4hr ago and here is what I think-1. Feels sturdy and premium in hand.2. 90hz looks absolutely fine, you won't miss 120hz3. In normal usage, the phone did not heat.4. Charged from 20-100% in just 15-20mins. My mind was blow away.5. Cameras- I didn't use it much but a sample image is attached which I took from the primary rear camera. So far it looks good to me.6. UI is clean but there were a lot of permissions which I had to accept to use the basic things like camera, search in the drawer. It clearly says in the policy that it shares my data. I believe we cannot do much about this.This is my initial impression, will update accordingly in the future."
4,Ratnakaram,"Phone not upto expectation as described, Bugs needs to be fixed",1.0,29,7,2021,1,531,I got OnePlus Nord 2 5G phone delivered yesterday. While setting up Phone got an update and updated my phone. Some bugs needs to be fixed by OnePlus team. Below are some findings.1. Charging time of this phone from 21% to 100% took  auround 16 minutes which is good but at the same time battery is draining too fast after 2 hours battery was 31%. As I am not heavy user of this phone but still battery drained fast.2. While installing apps or updating apps I get error message stating that my storage is full and need to remove unused apps. I purchased 256 gb internal storage and had 217 gb free storage.3. While I was using flipkart app I noticed that after 12 seconds app closes automatically and I need to reopen again and again after every 12 seconds. This is very annoying.Please think before you buy this phone.
5,Manny,Wait for updates to feel good about purchase.,1.0,28,7,2021,1,490,"7/28:Received this yesterday and first impression from look and feel was great.Was waiting for some reviews but will go first on this one, havent tried camera yet and should not as I moved from a Pixel 5 to this one. Purely for sake of google not providing dual apps even with eSim option.Things went south1) The mobile heated up a bit even during data transfer done via One plus switch App.2) VLC, gallery kept crashing. Videos will stop in middle and close, gallery will crash while you scroll on pictures.3) Few things are hard to find, not sure why camera need so many permission just to let you open it.4) Then came a update today morning and it hit the app cloner seems. Even with FB, Insta and WA on mobile, its not able to see it. I even reinstalled those to see if it picks it up.Seems like a half baked product with lack of testing rolled out to market. We are the test users.Product is overall okay and not my first one plus device. Just a bit of let down to start with and will have to wait on how soon these issues are sorted.Update 7/31:------------------ App cloner is showing apps now. However below apps continue to crash- Camera- whatsapp- youtuebe- Spotify- shuttle .  Ruined Android auto as well.I am sure list is long, but these are ones tried today and it's pathetic."
6,Firoz khan,Worst 32MP Front camera.,1.0,28,7,2021,1,402,I bought one plus phone for the first time and i am very disappointed with it..
7,Rajasrinivasan,Very bad and worst experience with OnePlus,1.0,28,7,2021,1,345,Bad experience with this from the moment it received.Mobile hangs and slow while the initial startup.Device not working properly and restarts several times automatically.App clone not working and I have the apps in my mobile it mentioned in the app clone but it doesn't showing anything to clone.Normal whatsapp chat drive backup not working... My old whatsapp backups are gone😡😡😡.Very bad and worst experience with OnePlus..
8,Dr. MUSADDIQ KHAN,Heating issues,1.0,29,7,2021,1,334,There are heating issues with average usage. Battery drains very fast.
9,Miracle,I want return,2.0,29,7,2021,1,312,Very bad phone. Over heating for reason. Even i dont play games. 😭😭 I want return it. Battery drain too fast. Only give backup of 2-3 hours. Plz Amazon help. My 30000 get waste. It's not even 24hours. My old realme narzo is better than this
10,Shiv Dwivedi,Defective/damage product,1.0,29,7,2021,1,306,"Ridiculous experience. My phone comes with dent, didn't expected from amazon and seller."
11,Tech_one,OnePlus Nord 2 is not worthy for 30k. Poor Display and Camera Quality,2.0,28,7,2021,1,207,Hi All. I have purchased OP Nord 2 for upgrade from my two years old Realme X. But my experience with Nord 2 is very bad. first its display is very bad quality compare to smartphone at 30k range. Even my Realme x display looking good against Nord 2. Its major highlight camera also very poor quality nowhere near to flagship sensor as OP advertising. Daylight pics are pathetic. After system update App Clone function is not working not able to use my 2nd whats app account. Call Recording function is not working which is my main requirement that is working flawless in my realme x. I think OnePlus make fool of us. Everyone who is purchasing will regret afterwards. So beware of OP Nord 2.
12,Jaydip P.,My experience after 14 days,5.0,28,8,2021,1,190,"I am writing this review after using this Mobile from Last 14days. I know the confusion of a person who is going to spend Big amount of money on mobile. I gone through the same phase and I willl try to give my honest review about OnePlus nord 2 and cover all the aspects of it. I will make sure that after reading this review you will easily make your decision.1) Camerarear camera : 5/5front camera : 4/5Awesome Rear camera with 50MP main perform super. I have attached images for reference. Focus is very fast and dynamic range is also Plus point.front camera is also good buy note best but I can say that over-all it's good in this price range.So many users are complaining about colour os code merge into oxygen os but I feel that camera quality is improved due to this. camera features are well organized compare to only oxygen os.2) software experience : 5/5It's awesome experience for me as I am coming from MIUI ( redmi note 4 ). Clean UI without any bloatware and ads.3) Performance : 5/5All applications are working very smoothly. I never encounter any lagging issues till now.  I didn't play havey games on it so I am not aware about gaming performance. over-all I can say ""Phone makkhan ki tarah chalta hy"".4) charging time : 5/5super fast charging.5) Face recognition Speed : 5/5it's very very fast similar to charging Speed.6) Fingerprint sensor Speed : 4/57) Battery Life : 4/5It's give you 6-7 hours screen on time which is  good. For me Full charging Last for 1.5 days.8) Carrier Aggregation and network quality : 5/59) Look  : 5/5when you hold it on your hands it's look very primium Mobile. I have grey colour which comes with Matt finish.10) Ram management : 3/5This is bit disappointing part in OnePlus nord 2. I think this will improve after software update so no need to worry. 11) Heating issueYes Mobile is heating bit when you use continuesoly for long time. But this is classical OnePlus issue and It can be solve through software update.12) Haptic feedback : 5/513) Display : 5/514) speaker : 5/5dual speakers with High loudness makes is awesome 😎conclusion :If you are normal user and looking for well balance Phone in all aspects then OnePlus nord 2 made for  you in this price range. Just buy it and please don't forget to Thank me later 🙂"
13,Amazon Customer,"Bugs in software, important functionality not working",1.0,2,8,2021,1,171,"Nord 2 software is full of bugs.Clone app is not working after the last update. The ones who had installed lost their data. Fix is expected in the next build, however, one is not sure when that would be available.So, if one is using dual apps, then think twice. I still need to carry my old phone as dual app is not working.Also, OnePlus care(support) has no clue about extended warranty. Paid for extended warranty, 4 days have passed since then but one plus support has no clue.Photo access from gallery is very slow. If one is having hundreds of photos in gallery then pictures take time to load when scrolling through them. Even my previous 2 year old phone fared way better.Software optimization is lacking."
14,Stanley,Oxygen OS becomes crap,1.0,28,7,2021,1,155,The phone overall is great but the OS has lots of bugs. Like its not even 1 day but I had the cloner app installed for Whatsapp which suddenly gets removed after latest update. It shows that no app is installed for which cloner is applicable. I would expect Oneplus to have their software sorted out if they are targeting the premium range users.
15,A akhil,Worst camera clarity,1.0,29,7,2021,1,139,I believed in one plus and bought this but camera clarity is below the mark..no light enhancement photos are very dull..not worth it at all
16,SANDEEP,Oneplus is now Oppoplus or Realmeplus,1.0,29,7,2021,1,131,Using it since 2 days and facing so much problems. Restarts automatically in Recovery Mode. Too much bugs in Oxygen OS. Not able to clone app inspite having required Apps. Not happy at all. Seems that I have spent my money for a 3rd class category phone.
17,Amazon Customer,Best android phone I have used till date,5.0,28,7,2021,1,131,-The refresh rate is just awesome-Camera is fabulous-Gaming is excellent-65 Watt charger charges in 38 minutes-Display is soothing-Color is just wow.. nothing like before.-Wow dealIn short it is the best android launch of 2021
18,sajal jain,Review,3.0,28,7,2021,1,124,Battery drains fast 😑Superb charging speed (0to 100) 33 mins🤗Display goodBack camera thumps upFront camera quite week😦Brightness okay!!
19,rohan badgujar,Phone stopped working after 4hrs,1.0,4,8,2021,1,101,I was very excited once I received the phone.But i dont know why the phone switched off by itself after 4hrs of usage and never started again. Can be poor quality of the oneplus new series. Now a days oneplus is not working well for its customers
20,jagadeesh,Awesome look,5.0,28,7,2021,1,99,Splendid in style
21,Vivek Gupta,Bad display .looks like a cheap smartphone,1.0,29,7,2021,1,90,I am using one plus 5t currently ..Ordered one plus Nord 2 to upgrade my existing phone. Trust me the display of this Nord 2 looks like a cheap smartphone. Colours of one plus 5t are way nice and better. One plus is losing its credibility and brand value . Looks like a cheap smartphone. Using Nord 2 don't give a premium feel.
22,Abhinay,Nothing Different from the previous One Plus Phones,3.0,28,7,2021,1,84,"Delivered yesterday and initial impressions was good . But then when i enrolled my finger print that's when the issue started. The phone wasn't able to read the fingerprint at all . No matter how many times i tried it didn't work . Since the one plus store is very near my place i took the phone over there and they said the had to calibrate the sensor and after that i haven't faced any issue as such .Update after going to the store , still the issue persists technician came and verified the same and the replacements on the way . Hopefully won't face any issues with that one ."
23,Tapas,Worst battery performance,1.0,29,7,2021,1,85,"Display is good, camera is average , speaker quality is everage , I am not a gamer so I can't measure performance, but definitely I can say it gives worst battery performance ,it gives 3-4 hours sreen on time although it charged the battery in 30-35 mmonutes , overall I am very disappointed 😞😞😞😞"
24,Pankaj,Good camera and good phone but with issues,3.0,29,7,2021,1,82,The phone's good but I don't know why my apps keep getting closed automatically. I am a little disappointed with this behavior. It happens randomly. I don't expect this kind of nonsense with a 30k device.
25,Saurav Chatterjee,NORD 2- The flagship killer! Smooth as butter.,5.0,28,7,2021,1,77,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   TL;DR: Classy look and feel, 12GB version is smooth as butter, the pictures are detailed and true to life, Charges to 90% in just 30minutes with its 65w Dash Charger, No 3.5 mm headphone jack, free basic phone case in box.👉🏽 Received it today within a day of ordering the phone. So, this is the initial first look impression. Plus I've added my experience of using it for a week.This is what I liked-1) Transition to the new phone was super easy thanks to the One Plus ""Clone Phone"" app.2) The on-screen finger print sensor and the face recognition works like a flash!3) Great haptic feedback, whether you type, use gestures, notifications you can feel it well and it's a great user experience.2) The 90Hz refresh rate and the 12GB RAM makes the phone ultra smooth, transitions are seamless. The OnePlus launcher is pretty intuitive and gesture controls are cool.3) I wish there was the option to disable or uninstall few inbuilt (bloatware) apps like Google Messages, Play Movies etc. directly from phone's app manager. However, you can enable developer mode and then uninstall those apps manually by connecting your phone to the laptop and then via adb commands.4) The Grey model is having matte finish while the Blue Haze has glossy finish. While both the phones are very good in terms of grip and are not fingerprint magnets.5) The main camera is too good, you get really true to life detailed pictures, portraits are professional, macros are great as well. Need to check how it performs in low light. I've added two photos (of new shoot of pine plant & Building facade), not sure if they would be uploaded in high quality or not, however, the detailing is superb.6) Battery performance seems well optimized and the dash charger charges the battery from 0% to 90% in less than 30 minutes. Really Impressive charging speed🔋. My phone has lasted for approx 1 day 23 hours with singe charge &light usage. With heavy use like watching couple of hours of movies+ calls+ social media on screen time -- it lasted about 12-13 hours.7) Those of you who use Google Play books to read epubs, it's gonna be a great experience to read the books in ""eye comfort"" mode for longer duration.8) The free phone case that's provided is pretty decent, it's got raised ridges for the camera and the screen so you can use it until you get cases of your choices available in the market. Plus the grip is good.9) I really find the slider useful to switch between 'Silent', 'Vibration', 'Ring'. Really thoughtfully made.What could have been better?1) It's always good to give people the power to make decisions. OnePlus could have kept the easy to use 3.5mm headphone jack, it's not a big deal for me but it adds convenience and the need to not have another extra device to keep track of and charge regularly. Plus, frequently using the charging port for inserting the adapter for USB-c to 3.5mm earphone jack could be problematic. Also, you can't fast charge and listen to audio in that case. Using a Bluetooth earphone is fine, but 3.5mm jack is still the most practical audio interface because: Ease of use, longevity, convenience. (It's a con for me, I've got BT earphones still love wired earphones for sound quality, ease of use)2) There isn't any secure folder (Samsung users would know the benefit of it)3) The OnePlus Gallery app is fine, however you can't add rich text with customization in the edit mode to your images on phone.4) The Battery! Could have provided a 6000mAh battery, too much to ask for? No- Samsung is providing it. However, thanks to the super-fast fast charging (within 30-40 mins) you won't feel this much. Remember to keep your dash charger safe!"
26,Amazon Customer,NOT up to the mark,3.0,2,8,2021,1,70,"I was excited to get the One plus Nord2 5G phone in hand. I was a user of One plus one earlier and then moved to Redmi k20 Pro. and then again back to One+1 nord 2.But got disappointed with the performance of the new phone from oneplus.I used to get better battery backup and good camera interface in Redmi K20 pro even after 2 years of use.The oxygen OS getting mixed with color OS is pathetic. Lots of lag in applications.  Especially the one I got irritated is the Auto rotate option. I enabled Auto rotate for  watching you tube and all videos, but after a phone call , I noticed the dialer gets rotated but will not turn to normal screen even after keeping the phone straight , I have to restart the phone to get the dialer straight from rotated.Another issue noted is the camera focus, when we try to scan the bar code on whatsapp web, it takes time to capture or read the barcode , even when we try to take close shots pictures, i see the camera is not able to focus fast and stays blurred for a long time, then we have to adjust our self to get the clear picture.Over all the phone is light weight, and easy to handle. I did not feel heat up, unless i enabled hotspot for laptop connection. Being an earlier one plus user, I hope OnePlus come up with updates to solve these issue faced by users."

29,Mohan,It's premium! Best phone under 30k nord is direct answer!! One bad is it asks many permissions,4.0,28,7,2021,1,59,I bought this as gift for my father!! Will share my First impressions.Pros:- In hand feel is premium felt like using samsung s series.- Display top notch for the price 👌 with 90hz.- Practically oneplus made good camera phone under this price point.- This is a perfect 5g phone has all bands.- still oxygen os is main layer and feels like oxygen os- build quality is strong.As hardware good device.Cons :- kinda oppofication code base destroys oneplus UI experience.- asks many kinda permissions while setting up device. Like for camera app asks call permissions. Unwanted permissions.Overall its good phone for the price. It's start phase of oppo-fication!!Please oneplus stay as oxygen os don't turn into something else. That's the key mvp of oneplus.

34,Viral,SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH IMEI NUMBER,1.0,29,7,2021,1,46,"Don't buy this product. It has some serious issues with IMEI number. Any OnePlus system may not recognize the IMEI code for the mobile and then your mobile will be ghost for OnePlus. In this case, you will not be eligible for warranty. This has happened with me and now OnePlus team is extremely lethargic and least interested in addressing this issue."
35,Anonymous 1,Not worth buying,3.0,29,7,2021,1,42,"I received this phone yesterday and I'm really disappointed with pathetic camera as it can not capture good pics with close shorts & mostly this phone camera provides over contrast images in daylights and doesn't provide decent image in night mode & battery drains fast. Only thing you can be happy about this phone is battery charges very fast with 100% in just 33 minutes. I feel like cheated with this product purchase and if Amazon is checking on reviews. Please take back this phone & refund the amount or provide a better replacement in the same price range.Update 15/08 - Overall performance is ok now, however in close shots rear camera struggles.Update 27/08 - I still feel it's not worth buying. And for those who want to buy new handset in this price range should wait for Pixel 5a release in India."

45,Josh,Great Handy Phone For the Price.,5.0,28,7,2021,1,27,"First Impressions-will update detailed reviewThe phone is solid, feels good in hand, small size, can be used single handedly, the back glass does not attract fingerprint. I have the haze blue variant. It's a glossy finish. Some YouTubers say that the gray has a matt finish, so you can checkDisplay: Display is crisp. The brightness levels are good for indoor and outdoor usage. Doesn't get as bright as OnePlus 9 series, but decent enough. There is little blue tint that you notice when you tilt the screen Don't know if it's common.Speakers: Speakers are decently loud. I thought it would be low, but I liked the sound output. Call quality is also decent. During calls , No issues in hearing the other person, earpiece are also decently loud. I won't say it's the most clear I have heard. Overall you won't ve disappointed with the sound output, it can go decently loud.Software: Oxygen OS is smooth, doesn't come with a lot of bloatware, although u may have to be cautious of some permissions like that in search bar and there are some built in Oxygen OS Apps. Can be easliy avoided. There are a few bugs, like the vibration motor intensity change is not working well on my phone. I will report the same in the communityCamera: Main camera is really good. can take night shots as well with adequate details. Performs really well indoors and outdoor. Wide angle camera is below average. The details are not good. It can only be used to put some pics on social media. I am considering it a single camera device. So a better deal compared to Pixel 4a (because 4a has become an year old). 2 mp mono camera- I doubt if it even worksCharging- Battery life is decent, can easliy last one full day. Charging speeds are good, if the atmosphere is cool. I tested the 65W charger, charges the phone fully in around 45 mins, although I am not going to use it daily, because fast charging takes a toll on the battery life. So charging with a 20W charger, even with that charges decently fast.Performance: Haven't done gaming yet, will update the review after that. But general performance is very good. No glitches, apps are wroking pretty smoothly. Doesn't heat up in normal usage.Update after 15 days of use-Initially the battery drains fast, but it's normal for a new phone. Post 3-4 complete recharge cycles, the battery is now performing as per expectations.The main camera quality is really good, can even take some really crisp night light photos. Gaming performance is smooth for casual gamers. The phone doesn't get heat up that much. It remains within limits. Definitely not a full fledged gaming phone.The software experience is very good, that's something which lacks in a lot of android phones. The UI and transitions are very smooth, no visible lags, and the best part is it's single hand usability. Overall it's a great phone for power users and professionals. Definitely not the most feature rich or on-paper powerful, but it ticks most of the boxes.AFTER 3 MONTHSA lot of bugs.....screecast and bluetooth doesn't work well"

47,Prehangma limboo,Wow what a Heater,5.0,6,8,2021,1,28,"Thankyou team Oneplus and Amazon for ruining my 2years of pocket money saving s and giving me this Heater Im happy Now I have it, I'm warming food and tea most of the time with it,So frustrating thing is Heating issues and battery drain with this phone other issues I can handle it.I ordered first handset but it has display issues and order replacement and I got it.OnePlus brand is known for a quality product few years back I don't know why they are playing with there own reputation.Otherwise its a good phone, except you if you can ok with heating issues."
48,Vikram Haibate,Best phone in this segment!,5.0,29,7,2021,1,28,Initially I got defective piece but eventually it was replaced by Amazon.Hence rewriting the review again.1. Design 5/52. Performance 5/53. Battery life 5/54. Camera 4/5(front camera needs bit improvement. Rear camera is superb)5. Connectivity 5/56. Video playback 4/57. Audio playback 6/5(the best)
49,Gagandeep Kaushal,OIS and processor winner,4.0,28,7,2021,1,26,Recently bought it. Build quality is not too satisfying but a good phone cover should be fine.Pros :1. OIS in such a low price2. Mediatek Dimensity 1200Cons :1. Plastic body2. Wide angle camera's low light performance not satisfactory3. 4500mah is a low Battery capacity. Would have not increased the production cost much for a 5500+ mah battery
50,Ashraf PM,"Bought 2times , returned one. Dangerous phone",1.0,14,9,2021,1,26,"Earlier I put my negative review here, after buying the second Nord5, but they didn’t publish it. I think they publish only positive reviews plus very few negative reviews so as to get rating above 4. The battery drains too fast, phone heats occasionally. Be cautious before buying.  Nord2 exploded few times in India."
51,Tomhawk,No HD Streaming on Prime and No HDR on Netflix,1.0,29,7,2021,1,23,"I bought this phone as an all-rounder to stream multimedia and play games but now I regret the decision as this device is unable to stream HD content on prime video despite having WivevineL1 certification, HDR playback on Netflix is also not supported as you can see from the attached screenshot.OnePlus customer care is pretty useless as they said they're unaware of this issue. This could be a device specific problem.Also the phone case I recieved was slightly deformed, this is definitely not the experience you would expect when you spend around 30K for a smartphone."
52,Customer,"Not really a flagship killer, but certainly checks ""most"" boxes",4.0,28,7,2021,1,21,"Launched at 12AM, ordered at 12:03AM :PThis is my primary and only phone now, and after two days of usage, well...- Body: Feels good. Really. They have perfected the edges and feels solid to hold, does not feel flimsy, if only they reduced the camera bump a little.- Screen: The 90Hz AMOLED is love at first sight. <3The colour reproduction, the viewing angles, the scrolls, they are just amazing.- Battery: Lasts me more than a day, and charging is a breeze, takes less around 20 minutes to reach from 10% to 100%. Does get a little warm with continuous screen time, but not worrisome standards.- UI: The haptics and the tiny animations they put in are extremely thought out, like a tiny circling dot around the front camera when in use, and ability to change the fingerprint animations, etc. My first OnePlus, don't judge me if these are new to me.- This is my first in-display fingerprint phone, and I am not sure if its just mine, or in general, but coming from a solid physical fingerprint scanner, I feel this scanner misses a few hits, you really need to know the exact area, etc. Not a deal breaker. The animations and haptics compensate.- Camera: High hopes. Normal daylight shots are fine, but ""ultra-wide"" is disappointing. Night ultra wide goes haywire. Portraits are okay, good skin tones, but bokeh feels out of place. Heavy image processing, feels artificial. The camera UI isn't ergonomic and feels out of place for OnePlus. No Macro.- Software: Day 2 and software update for Oxygen OS.- No Memory card, lack of expandable storage :x- No headphone jack :(Let's see what happens.12 days after:Received two OTA updates, not much camera changes as company claims, but Wifi connection becomes seamless.Camera: My my still so weird.4k 60fps N/A. ""Ultra crisp portraits"" becomes inactive in 'portrait' mode, only works in regular photo mode. 50mp inactive for Night mode. Front camera still average, they desperately add extra white. HDR looks too artificial. 'Move further away' keeps popping up on portrait, even though subject is more than an arm's length, and the bokeh messes up. *All that can be fixed with an update*Video: Supports 2160p on Youtube, but no HDR compatibility on Netflix, Prime.Battery: I am a regular user, and I am still left with 40 - 45% battery after a day. And charging this is such a bliss, max 15 - 20 minutes and voila 100%."

54,Abhi Shah,Too low battery life🔋,2.0,6,8,2021,1,23,"After 2 weeks of use here is my review.Pros:1. Look & feel.2. Rear camera & photo quality.3. Fast charging. 100%🔋 in 30mins.4. Fingerprint sensor.Cons:1. Worst battery life.2. 5 hrs screen on time only.I've used only one 4G sim. If I've used both sim slots guess the battery backup. Oh sorry this is 5G smartphone. Wait for 1-2 hour screen on time when 5G come.My 3.5 years old mobile Realme 1 (3410 mAh) has batter 🔋 life than this so called flagship oh sorry Oppo smartphone  with ColorOS😅.If you are not after brand, then go for Poco F3 GT. For same or less amount it'll give superior performance in every segment compare to OnePlus Nord 2."

56,Sandeep Singh,Only for One plus Users and Not Worth the Price,3.0,28,7,2021,1,22,This phone feels good in the hand. Specs-wise it's a killer as top-notch processer 8GB ram cameras are also good.But the issue is the processer as it is not fully optimized. I am getting slow performance as of now.Overall Recommended but only to the One Plus users. If you are trying OnePlus phones for the first time then I am not recommending you.

59,ASHISH RANJAN,"Solid build, amazing camera , good battery backup, superb gaming performance, ultra smooth display",5.0,28,7,2021,1,18,"What's not to love about this phone, i was a OnePlus 6 user since May 2018 and the phone was running fine but I just bought this phone on impulse by just seeing the specs and the price point.....and i am glad OnePlus didn't disappoint. Ordered it on 26th July and received it today , been using this phone for 3 hours and i am just loving it. People are comparing this phone with Poco F3 GT but let me tell u guys that the UI experience u will get with MIUI is nowhere close to Oxygen OS, not to mention better cameras. I am glad OnePlus is back to the flagship killer segment and not just flagships. No overheating issues as of now....and everything is on point. A big shout out to Amazon for superfast delivery."

Thanks."

66,sreedharan,Pros and cons as per my usage,5.0,28,7,2021,1,16,Excellent flagship mobile.Pros and cons as per my usagePros:1) Main advantage of this mobile is its camera.Able to get natural colour most of time and this time one plus changed their front camera and 32 MP camera is good for  selfies.One plus worked on camera a lot.2) Another Pro is 65w charger which charge my mobile from 0 to 100% in 30 min.3) Design wise it's looking like mini one plus 9 and also they gave Corning gorilla glass protection both front and back.4) UI is pretty smooth to use and processor is also bit fast.Cons:1) 90 Hz is good but still 120 Hz is better in this price range.2) There are many pre installed apps and some are not removable.3) Getting ads sometimes.4) Not very much friendly for gamers as facing slight hanging issue in bgmiApart from this overall performance is good and camera is best in class.Design is elegant.Resale value for one plus is good compared to other android smartphones.If you are not a gamer and need mobile for photography and professional use blindly go for this.
67,Me,OnePlus nailed it this time,5.0,29,7,2021,1,15,"OnePlus has done a great work with this phone. It is more robust as well as good looking than the previous Nord.Yes, the software is a bit different. Someone even pointed out that the apps are asking for unnecessary permissions, but personally I don't feel that is a security flaw (MI and IQOO does that too)About the product:1. The Grey Sierra version has frosted gorilla glass on the back that resists fingerprints.2. The screen is bright enough to be visible in bright sunlight (no need for those 1200 nits bright panels)3. Plastic body but has a premium look beware of scratches. Even if the gorilla glass is resistant the body isn't.4. The camera OIS works like a charm when taking night mode photos, slowmo videos, normal videos and zoom shots.5. Camera quality is better than the previous Nord but not as good as flagship phones. This camera can definitely give you Instagram ready shots (with a bit practice)6. The best part is the charging speed. Gets the battery from 10-90 in 20mins. Plug in when you go for a shower and it's fully charged when you come back. The battery will definitely last for more than a day with normal use. If you game for 3 hours a day then you would need to charge it at least twice but the charging speed definitely solves this problem.Summing up: I was sceptical while buying this phone because people usually would complain about how bad their OnePlus phones are on Instagram comments as well as reviews on Amazon but in the end this phone is definitely worth it. It also has more than five 5G bands making it future ready.I have added some sample shots. If you liked the review then vote this as helpful."
68,jagadesh,Satisfied,4.0,28,7,2021,1,13,"Based on first impression1. This is handy actually and weight distribution is good.2.Camera seems to be good, took few indoor shots .( will update after a week)3.Amoled display, so good in dark mode4.Battery backup is so far good and no heating issue.5.Faster and smoother.cons:1.hd content streaming in amazon is not there ( issue resolved after update)2. while watching 8k videos in 4k , video is freezing (not the display)3.Unable to clone the apps( issue resolved after update)4.seperately need to buy 3.5 jack adapter5.Under the screen protector there is dust that forces me to remove the protector.Worth buying and its big upgrade from previous mobile for me.Will update the comments in a week ."
69,Mayukhi Sinha,Worst Phone ever by one plus.,1.0,2,8,2021,1,15,Worst Phone ever. I am just unable to use the phone. Call quality is really bad..All the application keep on crashing. Cannot connect to red cable club. Just bought phone and showing out of warrenty.I have been one plus phones since last 4year. This is the worst model possible created by one plus team.
70,anita,Average smartphone with a lot more heating issues,2.0,3,8,2021,1,14,I received nord 2 on 29 August after using for 6 days this is my review. -The phone is average in all its aspects such as average camera quality majorly front camera(not getting clear image some blurring is there). -Charging is fast in 20 min 100% but it causes a lot of heating issues I fear after reading the news of oneplus nord 2 blast. As the phone heats in normal usage also.-Asks for so many permissions and hampers the security.-Apps are working fine and smooth.-Fingerprint scanner and qr scanning takes sometime not that fast.-I exchanged my realme 2 pro with this and now I can't return this phone @AMAZON is not giving refund option. As a PRIME member first bad experience with amazon. -My 3year old phone worked better then this one.And people and company saying explosion happened due to external factors so I guess we are not allowed to carry oneplus nord 2 in our pockets it might cause some external issue.🙂-Lastly I think I should have waited for Google pixel 5a instead of buying this phone.Don't buy this phone I will say.
71,Taurus,Nord 2 on daily use,4.0,1,8,2021,1,10,"I have been using the OnePlus Nord 2 for about 5 days. Let me assure you this is the review of a regular 'user' of phone and not by a reviewer!1. The Nord 2 looks premium. If you want to flaunt the colour of blue haze variant, you shouldn't use the back cover which covers it's looks! But if you are particular about smudges and scratches better put on the cover. It also has a (plastic) screen cover pre-applied.2. The amoled screen is bright and has a decent visibility in daylight. The punch hole can be a disturbance if you are switching from a notch screen.3. The software (oxygen os 11.3) is clean, less spammy but has a number of issues. For e.g the app cloner isn't recognising apps to clone and if you are using two accounts of whatsapp, telegram etc, you are stuck. Hopefully the software is updated with corrections.4. The sms app takes quite a while (sometimes irritatingly long time) to match the contact input from the address book.5. Apps load faster than other custom o.s.6. Battery lasted one full day with 90Hz display with routine daily usage of multiple apps (no videos or games).7. Charged from 20 to 80 in approximately 15 minutes. There is heating with charging but not much with non-game usage.8. There is a set of stereo speakers with a fair quality sound - not great.9. Camera is pretty good both in daylight and in dark.10. There is Corning gorilla glass both in front and back which is good but the frame is of plastic which could be a dampener. Also, there is no 3.5 mm jack.Overall, OnePlus Nord 2 is good value for money phone if you are upgrading from midrange and not yet wanting to go for 'flagships'. The phone has a good 5g processor, clean o.s, promised software support and brand value.Update as on 25th September 2021Till now, the OS isn't supporting dual apps except WhatsApp and telegram. My enquires to the technical team yileds only vague and uncertain replies. This is is indeed a deal breaker for those who use multiple cloned apps. I am not certain if OnePlus is even aware of this issue in their phone"
72,den,Not the typical OOS,4.0,29,7,2021,1,9,"The phone is definitely underclocked, you need to enable high-performance mode to get the flagship experience. because on normal mode, the performance is close to Snapdragon855, in the high-performance mode, it's close to SD870 also it heats up quickly in this mode.- For some weird reason, the motion and gesters option asks for call history and manage calls permissions- UI is uneven in many areas- The Camera application, battery page, Display settings page, Storage page are straight from Color OS- Main cam is pretty good in low light as well- UW is soft and almost unusable in indoor/low light conditions- Display doesn't get brighter, as compared to competition- After the first boot- The photo auto-updated itself,*Without user permission*  that too written in  chineese language- 65W Charging is superfast- Very good haptics- Good set of speakers- 90hz is constant throughout the UI- Very good main and front cameras- Feels lightweight and doesn't feel big/ uncomfortable in hand"
73,Nikhat,Don't fall into trap by watching youtube reviews. My phone is not working after 30days.,1.0,4,9,2021,1,11,Phone is not working properly after 30days. My phone stopped working. Don't waste your money. Oneplus is now making people fool. Seriously 1month it was working fine. But now there is lot of bugs. My phone switch off automatically and not turning on. I visited service center. They told me there is technical issue so i have to wait for 8-10days to fix  problem. I just wasted my 30k for this cheap phone with branding of one plus. I feel cheated and very very disappointed.

76,Sanjay Jha,One plus Nord 2 5G is Worst phone pls don't buy it.,1.0,31,7,2021,1,12,I bought OnePlus Nord 2 5G phone after using it for around 5 hours . I kept it idle for 2 hours And now when I am trying to use it YouTube is getting forced closed after every 5-10min Gallery is also closing Camera is automatic shut down and WhatsApp videos are unable to play MX player stopped working.
77,Devika Biswas,2 phone in back to back,5.0,29,8,2021,1,9,"First I bought the Grey Sierra 12GB 256GB. I wanted to buy the Green Wood but that time it was not launched in India. After buying the Grey Sierra I was not disappointed at all. It looks fantastic, gives premium feeling. After using the phone for a month, I recommend my father to buy the Green Wood when it launched. I am telling you if you want to buy 12GB 256GB, close your eyes and buy the Green Wood. It not only gives premium feeling but it looks so amazing and unique with leather finishing matte look. Coming to the performance, camera is fantastic, phone doesn't head up. If you are using the phone continuously non stop the battery will not last for 1 day - 7 to 8hrs. Best part is the battery gets charged by 35mins (full). Overall the phone is amazing in this range. My advice is always the same, always handle your gadget with care, it will last long. Don't try to compare 3-4 handset all the time, it will mess up your mind. If you think you want to buy this go for it."
78,Krishna Kumar,Attention for one plus Nord 2 buyers,1.0,3,8,2021,1,9,First time I choose one plus but finally disappointed.The phone battery drains very fast....and front camera not up to mark...better to choose other phone ...don't believe on other rating.... worst videos will execute during night time.Now heating issue started after one week of buying nord2.dont waste your money ..after purchase u feel regret like me

It has been almost 20 days, I am waiting for refund, customer care does not care. Every time they say the refund will be done in 3 to 5 days. And I wait and call them again and again. Very very very bad from Amazon and I am a dissatisfied customer. Will never buy any mobile from Amazon."

82,Pratim,Something is terribly wrong,1.0,2,8,2021,1,11,Expected this phone to be superior to 6T.Camera quality is pathetic.Charging slower than 6T.It was a mistake to buy this phone.

I have used just 27GB from 128GB and the phone asks me to uninstall the third party apps.Utterly disappointed"
84,Amit Kumar,Good For Normal Users 👍,4.0,31,7,2021,1,8,"Lookwise it's just awesome one, single hand supported size phone, if anyone need mobile for normal uses like call,chat & lil bit entertainment With simple android interface then it's performance is good enough fast & smooth plus camera quality is also very good at this price point which I liked very much. Wrap charge works fast but battery drains fast too while gaming n doing some heavy task. Its not good for gamers even it handle games good enough I don't recommend this phone coz of small display,low refresh rate, lack of 3.5 mm jack which makes trouble while Playing games like cod, pubg etc, phone also gets heat and you won't be able to play long enough.i switched from poco X2 in which I usually get low fps & graphic settings but still it was comfortable & good device to play these games. Overall Overhyped product & I miss 3.5 mm jack the most😭. One more thing currently Amazon prime, Netflix & other ott platform not streaming in HD in my device even I hv tried all settings n discussed with tech support."
85,karun,"Good Phone, with out Bass settings for Bluetooth earphones/tws/buds",3.0,2,10,2021,1,7,"The phone is quite good and practical and only area oppofication is clearly felt is OnePlus is yet to enable audio enhancement for tws/Bluetooth.My OnePlus Bluetooth earphones & tws sounds awesome when used with OnePlus 6,but when connected to Nord 2 they sound flat lacks Bass as there is no Audio tuner enabled for Bluetooth earphones.OnePlus want to show the difference between Nord and OnePlus series phones and is clearly felt but playing with Audio settings is not a good idea.My old phone OnePlus 6 has some stunning features in UI than Nord 2, so rating 3.Will update to 4 when Audio tuner is enabled and 5 star if UI is good in future updates. attached screenshot too."
86,Manoj,Google's phone,1.0,29,7,2021,1,9,Writing review after 2 day of use.. What if I bought this for Google purpose. This phone does the same.. I don't know why everything is linked with Google. From phone dialer to messages. Why can't be just OnePlus.. and 35k for all this. Totally fed-up and disappointed with OnePlus.Best part you can't uninstall or disable any app like this.. you do force stop them but after some time they will restart automatically and you will never know.. Seems to me I have wasted my 35k on this.. suggesting others to must see the phone once by yourself before you buy it.. may be I will be able to save your money..  it's my only opinion...lastlyPhone name must be Google Nord 🤣🤣 not the Nord 2 from OnePlus
87,PARTHA,Jio SIM not working,4.0,13,8,2021,1,6,"Bought this phone a couple of days back for my daughter and she is happy with it except one major problem which is:1. Jio sim is not working. The SIM gets detected, signal tower bars are 90% but whenever she tries to call through JIO the option to select the Jio SIM is shown disabled. Incidentally, the JIO is in second sim slot. There is also no VoLTE setting option in the menu. Only voice over WIFI is present in settings menu and works for the other SIM.Oneplus should immediately come with some solution for this, pending which the Jio users may not be able to use this phone in all likelihood.Edit: After tinkering with settings I could enable Volte in my JIO SIM (2nd slot) and now its working. Although I can't clearly explain what was the change I did which triggered the Volte. It suddenly became enabled whem I was playing with different menus in DUAL SIM settings.Increased a Star feom 3 to 4."
88,Karthiga,My new companion ❤️,5.0,28,7,2021,1,10,Ordered the phone soon after the launch in Amazon on 26th midnight.. was waiting for the launch for a month.Totally excited after a super fast delivery.Extra excited on opening the package.The phone is super smooth and sleek as expected. In total love with it 😍😍Have been recommending to my friends since I opened the package 😃#oneplusnord2 ❤️
89,Abhishek,Frustrated within 7-8 hours of use,1.0,1,8,2021,1,8,"1. Many apps are getting crashed within seconds of launch.2. Showing storage full whereas the brand new phone has entire storage available.3. App cloner not working properly. Not allowing to import the back up.All such issues should be fixed immediately. Many people are facing same issues. But even after 4-5 days of launch, OnePlus developers are not able to solve the bugs.To add, camera quality is also not that good.Not sure which new issue will crop up going forward."
90,Jag Vedakumar,Fantastic Mid Range Smart Phone,5.0,28,7,2021,1,8,"Purchased this mobile on the day of Launch. Loved the phone, Great Packing and prompt delivery by Amazon as usual.Pros: - Great battery back up. For my typical day time use, the battery last for a day easily.-  Great camera for both indoor, outdoor as well as Night mode is awesome! Close to a flagship phone.- 90Hz screen is butter smooth. Its not 120hz but better than most phones in this range. Screen is bright and color representation is good.Cons/My dislikes:- No Expandable memory slot. If you are using cloud services, you should be fine but disappointed.- No Headphone jack. I knew it before I bought it but still, I feel like it could have been left alone. :)"
91,Anand Bhat,Don't buy this phone. After sale service is horrible,1.0,5,10,2021,1,7,"I purchased this phone with high expectation. After somedays of use my charger have issue. So i send my charger to the service centre. And after making so many followups and requesting calls finally i got my charger after 27days.It really make me feel sick. Everyday i chat with oneplus with whatsapp chat. They gave so many falls promises like they will follow up the issue and contact me within 24 to 48hours.but i never get that followup message from them. Then i got my service centre number in google(oneplus won't have their service centre numbers)and contact them personally. They said charger is replaced but due to man power problem they are not courier the charger. Which is completely nonsense. And after 1week they courier the charger. But now I'm facing onother new problem the adopter is heating while charging the phone. Again i contact oneplus. They simply said that they can't fix it.and said to contact the service centre. They again diagnos the charger and give a solution to it. But service centee is far away from me. So i couried the charger and they take nearly 30days to reach me back. Now the oneplus saying that contacting service centre is the only option they won't providing new charger and giving me more work to solve my problem. I don't understand what is the use of waiting 30days and contacting oneplus. I don't know what to do know. And who will be the responsible if any damge occur in future. And phone also get heated after some time of normal use. Camer also not focus subject so many time. Totally not worth for money. And if you face any problem after the sale, you will get a horrible service. So better not buy this phone. Not worth for money n Your life become misserable. If i have minus point I'll give it to them only because of such horrible after sale service. And you have to wait 2 hours to get them in chat. And they won't consider your feedback and won't take any action against it. buy some better mobile to make your life easy."
92,Aman Jain,Phone has too many issues with almost everything. Won't suggest to buy.,1.0,4,8,2021,1,7,I used to earlier use a Realme XT and exchanged it for this in hope for a better and premium phone but this phone makes me regret changing it. It feels like a downgrade even though this phone costed twice as much.Looking at the reviews it almost seems like there are different versions of this one phone. Many have faced numerous issues and in my case it was no different.•Front camera is working like a 5MP camera with no in-depth colours or clarity.•Back camera is very good.•Battery doesn't last for an entire day(8 hours) even with normal usage.•There are prominent heating issues. The phone heats up under normal usage.•The display doesn't looks good.•Speaker is actually quite good.•Charging speed is excellent but the drainage nullifies it's positive.The merging of Oxygen OS with that of Realme & Oppo OS has been a disaster. Too many bugs and issues with the phone. Doesn't feel like a OnePlus phone really. The software update too hasn't solved any problems. I just hope they get it right with the future updates.I've been really disappointed with this phone and will be going for a replacement and will update the review if/when i get one.Would really suggest others to not buy this phone currently.
93,Imtiyaz Ansari,Everything you dont need.,1.0,30,7,2021,1,11,"Dont buy this product, there is display issue, apps crashing automatically while you are working on it, heating issue and so on. PATHETIC"
94,Albert Bozeh,Deep regret,3.0,31,7,2021,1,6,"With lots of expectations I had purchased this phone but it turned out to be a big regret. Let me quickly highlight some pros and cons as per my observations : Pros :1. Phone is slim and light in weight.2. Charging speed is good enough.3. Quality of speaker is above average.Cons:1. First impression itself was bad because right after the initial set up, phone restarted and Chinese script appeared (picture of it is being uploaded for ref). Security for this phone is doubtful.2. I'm not a gamer or a heavy user, I just wanted a good camera phone. So considering the brand name OnePlus, I had mainly purchased this phone for camera but this phone's picture quality is not satisfactory at all. Rear camera is somehow ok (average) but the front camera is really bad. Infact my Poco M2pro's cam is much better (pictures from outdoor uploaded)3. Battery drains quite fast, doubtful about 4500 mah battery quality.4. No privacy in call recording, as soon as call recording starts it is being notified to the other person also.4. Brightness is very low especially in outdoors.This phone has much more cons than pros. At this price range we can get a much better premium phone. Now I'm regretting so much that I should have gone for Google pixel 4a or Iqoo 7 or Samsung A52."
95,7891014740,Software issues coming,3.0,29,7,2021,1,9,Software issues coming . Apps are getting closed autlmatically and also having some heating issues. Front camera giving results as of some cheap mobiles.I have applied for a replacement lets check after it gets replaced.
96,Vivek Sanghai,Huge Disappointment. Just a Marketing Gimmick,1.0,28,7,2021,1,8,"Received OnePlus Nord 2 (256GB/ Hazel Blue) on 27th July.I've been a loyal user of OnePlus devices, and they have never disappointed me.Carrying forward the legacy, I had a lot of expectations from OnePlus Nord 2. But OnePlus failed me this time.The moment I started the device, I faced heating issue. Camera is average. Images are blurred even at 2x zoom. I've asked for a replacement.Just a caution to future OP customers, it's no more the same OP that it used to be few years back. It's truly a Chinese product now.All Marketing, no quality."
97,kshitijagr,Best phone in this budget,3.0,30,7,2021,1,5,"In this budget OnePlus nailed the specs. Performance is fast, battery lasts more than a day and half. Camera quality is pretty good (again for the budget). I'm facing software issues but I do believe they'll be ironed out later as this is the first iteration of oxygen+color OS.EDIT: Changing the rating from 5 to 3 stars because of the terrible software. It was released completely uncooked. Night mode in camera always takes really blurry photos, what was the point of incorporating OIS? Keyboard location and mistouch prevention doesn't work. You can't delete pre-installed Google apps. OnePlus' messages and caller apps were better. For some reason, at times the phone says the SIM's roaming has activated but in reality it isn't. It's still toggled off in the settings. There are many more such bugs and I was waiting for updates from OnePlus to fix them, but the recent update hasn't changed anything."
98,Prudhvi Jagannadhan,Pretty Impressive product - TRUE FLAGSHIP KILLER!,4.0,28,7,2021,1,7,"I really like the NORD 2, everything from camera, processor, touch, display everything are a true upgrade to the previous NORD 1.* Gaming is one among the best- mobile is also not heating much.* Screen brightness is little low - it's below 1000nits.* Battery is little less 4500mh and backup is around 5-6hours but charger is of top quality it gets charged within 30min.* Camera are pretty Decent, primary camera is amazing- 50mp, wide angle is decent, no need of monochrome lense.* Overall - I give it 4/5( very impressive product)"
99,Saket Bhaskar,Premium smooth camera phone,4.0,30,7,2021,1,7,"I gifted this mobile to my Jiju on his birthday. I have listed out all pros and cons of this mobile phone after using it for one day.Pros:--1) Design & Look - Premium look. Use of glass back increases the premium appeal.2) Build Quality - Build quality looks good. But i have not performed drop test ;), so can't say much about it.3) Performance - AI (Artificial intelligence) enabled chip-set handles multitasking and heavy-graphic games without any hassle.  - Scrolling is very smooth due to 90Hz refresh rate.4) Display - AMOLED display is awesome.5) Camera - AI (Artificial intelligence) enhances color reproduction + Sony lenses offers accurate details + Optical image stabilization avoids blur pictures / videos due to shakiness. a) Photo - Daylight pictures are amazing.  - Low light pictures are average.  - Front Camera takes very good selfie pictures. b) Video -  Videos are also very good.6) Battery - Good battery backup. ~30 mins from 0% to 100% due to wrap charge 65w fast charging.7) 5G support - Not tested yet because 5G is not rolled out in India yet.Cons:--1) Battery - Slight heating issue while charging or playing heavy games.2) No headphone jack. So can't use wired earphone / headset.3) Value for money - 1+ Nord 2 is little overpriced until you use bank offer (1000 Rs. discount).Also they came up with 3 color variants but surprisingly they didn't release the green woods color variant which looks amazing. Hence deducting one point for both.Guys, Please let me know if this information is helpful for you then ill keep updating my review if my experience changes with usage."

102,Rahul,Got a waste product!!!!!,1.0,1,8,2021,1,6,I got totally disappointed with this.The initial impression was just amazing when I got this product in my hand.But after that it made me  so unhappy with OnePlus.Issues which I faced• It's 65W fast charger but it takes more than 3 hours to takeupto 70% battery.• once I completed charging the phone suddenly shows 1% charge with in seconds. And after 30 mins again it shows charge of 70%. I don't know what is this thing called.• The phone hangs when it connect to the charger. The display touch and fingerprint sensor not working while charging.•battery drains so fast.Am giving 1 star as rating because there is no option to give 0 stars. I donno why this issues with OnePlus? Or it might be the issue with the seller who sent me damaged product.Anyway it's a Total disappoinment for me!!!!!!!!

107,S Dash,Abysmal Display for a 35000 INR (470£) Smartphone,2.0,12,9,2021,1,4,"This is one of the worst displays I have ever experienced in a 470£ smartphone. A mere 100£ motorola phone has a much better display quality compared to this 470£ trash. The only selling point for this display is that it has a 90Hz refresh rate but at this price point, other manufacturers like Samsung are providing a 120Hz display. I personally don’t care much about these refresh rates. If it was a 60Hz display with a better quality (say similar to Samsung A71’s display), I would have definitely given it a better rating. But, the display is so terrible in Nord 2 that it is actually getting on my nerves that I have paid 470£ for this trash. No wonder why there are no demo versions of Nord 2 available in retail stores because OnePlus doesn’t actually want you to experience the display prior to purchasing it. The only reason I went ahead with purchasing it from Amazon was because its display was advertised as AMOLED. But, it is not in any way comparable to Samsung’s AMOLED. It looks like one of those cheap displays used by cab drivers for navigation.The battery life doesn’t impress me either. I think it is mainly due to the 90Hz refresh rate and unoptimized software. The moment the display is turned on, the battery starts draining significantly at a rate of almost 15-20% per hour. However, after I reset the phone to its factory settings, the battery life slightly improved and the discharge rate got slightly reduced. I wish I had taken screenshots of the battery reports before performing a reset so that I could have made a comparison with current battery reports. Nevertheless, the battery discharge rate is now slightly better but still requires optimisation.Prior to the reset, the heating issue was quite noticeable but not to the extent of how other reviewers have mentioned. After the reset, I haven’t observed much of this issue. Maybe this could be the reason for an improvement in the battery life. But, given the recent reports of explosion of Nord 2 devices in India, I no longer have confidence in the battery quality. The thing is that after the first case of explosion, Nord 2 compensated the buyer and tried to keep this news below the radar. Only after the recent explosion did I become aware of these events. Had I known about these incidents, I would have never bought this phone. This phone was supposed to be a gift to my mum, but I am no longer going to hand it over to her. She’s not a tech savvy person. She wouldn’t realise whether the device is heating up due to continuous usage or due to battery issues. I am not going to risk her life. Maybe there’s no manufacturing issues related to the battery. Maybe there’s some human error or external factors involved. The only way these distrusts can be remedied is when OnePlus releases an official statement and does not try to hide the incidents related to the explosion.Regarding the Mediatek Density chipset, it actually performs well to my surprise. Applications install quickly and the loading time of apps is quite low, say, in comparison to Samsung A71’s Snapdragon 730G. If you would like to know about the benchmark scores, then you could watch several videos by “Gary Explains” on his YouTube channel “SpeedTest G” where he has uploaded several such benchmarking videos about Nord 2.The sound quality of external speakers is loud and clear, and sounds good enough for watching videos and listening to music. Sadly, there’s no headphone jack. And, the camera quality is not bad either. But, I expected more from a 470£ smartphone. In comparison to my 450£ LG G5 which I had bought in 2016, the Nord 2’s camera is poor. It is not worth the cost that you are paying. Do not even try to use the “HDR” mode. It makes the photo quality even more terrible.So, in conclusion, I do not recommend this phone at all. It’s going to be my first and last OnePlus device that I’ll ever purchase. I don’t usually write reviews. But, since the display is so pathetically bad and the overall quality of the phone is poor too considering its 470£ price tag, I had to write one. Maybe if the display was good, I would have considered giving the benefit of doubt to other factors. But, I just wish that Amazon would take back this device and refund my money. I sincerely hope that Amazon takes my request into consideration. I would like to say this again: “I do not want this phone. Please take it back and refund my money.”"
108,MZB,Oneplus or OPPO ?,3.0,4,8,2021,1,4,"Few points... I regret buying OP Nord 2:Brightness : though one never use full brightness but it is not upto the mark. OP 5 has better brightness. Good for people using only dark mode. But surely a deal breaker for me.Display and Fonts : only 3 options. Min/default/max. Very uncomfortable with few apps specially apps like WhatsApp. Again a deal breaker.Audio Quality : earphone With connector, the SQ is just avg. Nothing great to justify 30k. Speaker quality is decent, just like all other phones but no where close to Samsung S series.Camera : No full screen mode for pictures. No zoom in/out for Selfie. PQ is decent, but no where close to Samsung.Contact Info on lock screen : Can't find so far how to put it.Update on receipt of Product :Ordered on 26th Delivered today. Yet to explore the phone completely but the first thing that caught my attention was manufactured by ""Oppo"". None of the reviews on Youtube (Damn, all are paid and minting money from manufacturers) mentioned about this.So my question to Oneplus team is... Is the oneplus brand completely taken over by OPPO and just the premium of oneplus brand is being charged on this phone?If yes, then... had the same phone been launched with OPPO's brand, the price would have been 2k-5k cheaper for sure.Deducting 2 stars for this atm!This is my 3rd phone with oneplus brand (Yes, using the word brand now). Will come back with review later on price to product proposition and originality of Oneplus Brand!And yes, there is a news on OP N2 blast on a new phone while the lady was riding the bicycle. That's scary!"
109,Paramita Chandra,Pls don't spend 35k for this phone.,3.0,2,8,2021,1,6,Here is the review after using the phone last 2 weeks ..Camera - AverageBattery life - GoodFingerprint reader - AverageVideo quality - Excellent productFace unlock - AveragePerformance - Average
110,Rohit Ravindranath,A review after 2 weeks of solid use!,5.0,8,8,2021,1,5,"To start of with, I've used an Exynos 990 S20+ for about 16 months now. The main reason for the switch from a ""Flagship"" to a flagship killer was because of performance and battery. And boy has this phone impressed me! I've listed some pros and cons to help you with the decision -Pros -1) Excellent performance. Absolutely no frame drops while gaming. Heating too is very reasonable. Never feels uncomfortable. You can literally throw anything at this Mediatek processor and it breezes through it.2) The display is beautiful! Take it from a guy who's used a Samsung 120hz, you won't really notice the 30hz drop. On direct comparison, there's definitely a difference, but not when you are using this device primarily.3) The Cameras - Contrary to all Youtuber's reviews, I'm not too impressed with these. Although the pictures turn out good, there is absolutely no consisitency between the shots and as a photographer it doesn't really give you the confidence to make this your primary shooter. 7/10 shots turn out good, and I would call it decent given the price point and list cameras under ""Pros"" for this device. The night mode on this camera is really good though!4) Battery , Charging - This is where this phone truly triumphs! You can simply not kill it in a day. Constant screen on times of over 7 hours. And warp charge, well it's pure magic. The charging time for this phone is just about 20 mins everyday! You end everyday with about 20-30% remaining, charges from 20-100% in about 20 mins.Now the Cons -1) Speakers - Although loud, lacks bass, and doesn't give any depth in audio coming out of it.2) Weight - Although it's 189 grams on paper, weight distribution of the phone is pretty bad , feels bulky to hold and certainly has a heft to it.3) Volume buttons ( software related ) - This is rather weird, the volume levels/intervals on this phone are not equally spaced, it's either too soft, or too loud, it's a constant struggle to find middle ground here.Final verdict - As you can clearly see, the Pros of this phone far outweigh the Cons, this is a TRUE FLAGSHIP KILLER! Glad to declare OnePlus is finally back to its good old days of making flagship killers. This phone receives 5 stars from me! Given the price point it comes at , it's practically flawless."
111,Adarsh,Overall disappointed - Serious heating issue,2.0,2,8,2021,1,4,"Updating my review comments.Note that I have returned this phone and refund issued. Amazon technician done an online diagnostics over call and confirmed that the device/battery temperature is abnormal even without heavy usage.Let me detail the cons first as it is more than pros. It is apparent that the phone was released without proper performance and UI testing.Cons:1. Heating issue - Even with mild usage the device is heating in a way that I couldn't touch the phone comfortably. Software update received on August 3rd did not rectify the heating issue. Informed OnePlus directly and they said the team was working on it. If it's a software issue, then they should put a fix immediately. This is a Priority 1 issue. But if it's a hardware related issue, then not sure.2. Oxygen OS UI (Color OS Integration): I was using a Realme 6 Pro phone and now the UI of OnePlus Nord 2 looks 90% similar to Realme UI/Color OS. OnePlus die hard fans would be terribly disappointed by this. Even the Camera UI looks exactly the same as my Realme 6 Pro phone. The business mindset of Oppo and OnePlus has ruined the legendary Oxygen OS. Bad job Oppo and OnePlus!!3. UI features - The irony and disappointing thing is Oxygen OS integrated with Color OS but for whatever reason some of the good features of Color OS are omitted here such as:- No dual sim display in dialer. User has to manually select the sim.- No customized option to set daily mobile data limit.- No tap on lock screen to snooze alarm. Need to slide to snooze. Okay, this is good for lazy people but that feature is not there- No Dolby Atmos/Dirac support with bluetooth headphones. Come on OnePlus, and there is no 3.5mm headphone jack. What are you guys thinking? Should we keep sound always on speaker in public places to enjoy Dirac or Dolby Atmos sound? But wait, then the phone speakers are not really good. Too less bass. Pub;ic would be disappointed with the sound. Another failure.- 32 MP front camera is good only in paper. Somehow its not working great as per multiple Youtuber's reviews. Don't take my word, experience it yourselves.- Once a software update is done, we do not have an option to see what was updated. Strange. Why is it so secret? However, you'd be able to see what is changing prior to performing the software update.- No option to schedule Night Mode option from Sunset to Sunrise. Well not mandatory as we have the option to schedule time. But this option is available in the Color OS/Realme UI.Pros:1. Rear camera - Decent performer. Don't expect too much. Colors don't look really natural as mentioned by the Youtube reviewers. But it's not bad either. Low light and night mode performance is also good but again don't expect too much.2. 5G bands - Supports wide variety of 5G bands. However, not sure if it's of a big advantage since n78 band is the most popular worldwide. And almost all 5G phones have n78. Still, this is a good thing to have a wide variety of 5G bands3. Ergonomics - Phone is easy to hold. But for those who have used bigger screens like say Realme 6 Pro might be disappointed.4. Display - This is good. Crisp and good colors. Both Vivid and Gentle (sRGB) modes perform really well. Refresh rate of 90Hz is adequate.Overall, don't buy this phone if your expectations are too high based on the OnePlus brand. If the issues mentioned can be fixed through software updates, then it's ok and if you're patient enough to wait for the updates. Think before you buy..."
112,Abhijit,Overall Champ!,5.0,23,8,2021,1,5,"This review is going to be a bit long, since I'm writing this review after almost a month of extensive usage.Ordered it on the first day the product was made available. As expected, got it delivered in 2 days, thumbs up for that. Was using a Huawei Honor Play previously. Got 3 OTA updates during this period.Build quality:Good enough build quality, has Gorilla glass 5 on the front and back but the frame is made up of plastic, not a dealbreaker I'd say. The buttons are nice and clicky, it has the iconic alert slider in it, works well too.Display:Coming from a phone having IPS panel, I loved the display on this one. That being said, it could've been a bit more brighter since the legibility under direct sunlight is not that great. Watching movies/video on this One has been nothing but excellent. HDR support on Netflix is still missing though, however it hardly matters for me.In-display Fingreprint Sensor:Works fine 95% of the time. However there have been ocassions when the fingerprint icon does not show up on homescreen.Software:Ad-free bloatware-free clean UI. AOD works well. The OTA updates I got were bug free. Nothing like Realme or Redmi.Speaker and haptics:The sterio speakers are outstanding, even at high volumes you wouldn't feel any distortion. Haptics are good enough too.Camera:The 50MP primery camera blew me away. The images turned out to be top notch even at low light conditions. The 8MP ultrawide camera is kind of okay-ish, they could've given a 12MP sensor instead of the useless monochrome 2Mp sensor. The front facing 32Mp camera does a good job in decent lighting conditions but the HDR algorithm on this One tends to blow out details in brightly lit conditions..Battery and Charging:I'm a person who always keep the internet turned ON. Either wifi or mobile data when I'ma away from home. I was easily getting screen on time of 6-7.5hrs on wifi and 5-6hrs on mobile data. Btw utilizing both the sim slots(Airtel and Jio).The charging time is just crazy. 10% to a 100% in less than 25 minutes using the 65W charger included in the box. OMG.Call Quality and Network Reception:Excellent. Took long calls(>30 minutes) using the earpiece, wasn't getting hot.Performance and Gaming:Excellent performamce. Did not feel any lagginess or stutter. Scrolling through instagram feeds was super smooth, thanks to the 90Hz refresh rate.Played BGMI as well as Genshin impact with ease at Smooth+ 60fps and Medium+30 fps setting respectively. Was getting around 50-52fps thoughout on BGMI and 24-27fps on Genshin impact. The phone became a bit hot after playing Genshin Impact after 30 minutes which is not surprising.Got the 8/128 varient for Rs.28,250 after 1750 discount for HDFC Bank Debit Card No Cost 6 month EMI.Display: 7/10Call Quality: 9/10Camera(Rear): 8/10Camera(selfie): 7/10Battery: 8/10Speakers and haptics: 8/10Performace and Gaming: 8/10Value for money: 9/10Hope you guys found the review useful."
113,Manjunath Rajanna,Value for money,4.0,14,9,2021,1,3,"Firstly I'm not a technical review writer. Will sum up in simple words.Please don't pay attention to negative reviews. They're just trash.Pros:-Phone is easy to handle.-Cameras ar good enough for the range and best in its segement.-Battery performance is pretty descent. I only charge once in a day which is sufficient for browsing, gaming, listening to the audio, you can watch up to 2 movies as well before you charge next. Think after doing all this your battery percentage is less than 20%, ain't matter, it has got 65w warp charge, in 20-25 mins your battery is full. Badass stunning outstanding charging which I love the most.-90hz refresh rate is pretty good, though if it had 120, woulda been at peaks.Cons:No default music app.No expandable memory storage."
114,SP,Display and heating issues,1.0,1,8,2021,1,5,"I have been using one plus 5 since last 4 years and its performance was excellent.  With that experience, i have purchased oneplus nord 2 for my friend.  From the third day, the display went for a toss.  When you unlock the phone with your fingerprint or PIN, the display just goes off and the screen becomes blank.  Phone gets heated up too!!  Didn't expect this kind of basic issue on such a premium phone.  Submitted the phone at oneplus service station and waiting for the replacement now.  Embarrassing situation as I strongly recommended this phone for my friend!!"
115,Kumari Sonal,Only in 2 days battery get blasted and back panel get damaged.,1.0,23,8,2021,1,7,"@oneplus, shame on this product. Please don't fool your customers. Oneplus nord 2 built quality is very cheap. This kind of product price should not be more than 7k-8k. Buyers who is thinking or suppose to buy this oneplus phone, Please think 100 times before that."
116,JS Rajkumar,It's a camera than a phone,3.0,8,8,2021,1,4,I bought OnePlus Nord 2 last week after a long wait. I love this phone for its brilliant camera quality and great look and feel. Softer and smoother than any other phone. It comes with integrated Google apps thus more of a Google inbuilt phone with no significant OnePlus additions. The worst part is No default Call app as it uses Google caller app that comes with stupid call recording feature which notifies the party on the other side whenever the active call is being recorded. I really got annoyed when the other party asked me to stop the call recording though it's a personal security enhancement yet it's necessary sometimes for dealing with some issues. However I like this Nord 2 for it's camera resolution and advanced touch screen.
117,Shivam Singh,Wrost product,1.0,31,8,2021,1,7,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Wrost product of my life first time I am belive in one plus phone these phone break  my belive on one plus brand  dont compare with apple wrost product one plus Nord 2 lots of hanging problem"
118,Shaunak Banerjee,A good phone but with some disappointment,4.0,5,8,2021,1,4,"Well as usual this is OnePlus phone and launced with big hype. Also it's my first OnePlus device. So after after 5-6 days of initial use a few points to note which one can think of before buying:Pros1. Superfast speed in terms of app loading, app installation, day to day usage2. Charger 20% to 100% charge in just 30 mins3. Camera: well the rear main camera is superb however I am yet to test it fully, front camera no complains so far as I am upgrading from Samsung Galaxy M51 and colour accuracy is better with nice filters4. Screen unlock with fingerprint and face unlock is real fast.5. Haptics are super smooth, I am in love with typing.6. Box content such as TPU case is of good quality7. And finally phone built. It's superb looks and feels really premiumCons1. Many apps have bugs. Prime Video it took 3-4 days to finally make it play HD quality videos2. Truecaller has some issues. It doesn't instantly shows the caller name when you get a call from unknown number. Hope this gets sorted in next update3. App notification in many other apps have delayed notification issue specially Outlook and PlayStoreOther things such as battery I will touch base, well it's not a 1+ day battery, it will give screen on time of around 5 to 6 hours max.Another contentious point which is neither pro nor con is the stereo speakers. In apps the sound is crisp, clear and loud enough but while calling the loudspeaker sounds gets too low at full volume also. So one has to take care of same."

121,Amit,Not upto the Mark ‼️,3.0,6,10,2021,1,3,"I received my phone today. Delivery is good. I am writing this review after using it for whole day. Will add later after few more days. I bought this phone after hearing lot of good comments and feedbacks about one plus phones. But this phone phone disappointed me. Specially the camera, I must say it's very very poor. My previous phone Vivo V9 , had far more better camera quality than this Nord 2.  Sound quality is also just ok ok.  Other things seems good. Will come to know after using it for few more days. One most important thing which I found very unusual, I wanted to share is that - just after completing initial set up, I clicked some pics and when I opened the gallery to see photos, I found one another folder containing 10 photos. Those pics were just wallpaper types, but when I checked the details it shows date of 20th August. This made me very disappointed 😞 which gave me feeling that I received some refurbished phone. I will check this with one plus also.Other features seems ok, but camera and music both are very poor.Will write in more detail after using it for some more days."
122,Akhter Junaid,Simply awsome,5.0,28,7,2021,1,7,"Great, sinply awesome in every aspect, great camera, display, charging, speakers everything.Great pricing too.A worthy upgrade from nord 1."
123,Mohammad Salman,Not Happy with This One Plus nord-2,1.0,3,8,2021,1,5,HiDon't even expect from one plus. This is really redicolous. First charged full and kept aside and while battery got drained out without any use in night in just 4 hours.Phone is getting heated only when we open it and I don't even use it then only it is heating.I think there is some issue in this brand. Never get such a complain about one plus.I purchased One plus 8 also but this time I am not happy with one plus.There is some issue with this brand. Need to look into this.I want to return the phone.
124,Mohit Dewan,"Great Product, Worth Shortlisting.",4.0,7,10,2021,1,4,"Yes, you can invest on this. I read some reviews which stated that it doesn't support some apps, camera quality is not good and poor battery life etc. But I will try to give an honest review.First of all the thing I love the most is that there's no blotware, changing my phone from Xiaomi to Oneplus was a great decision. Even after merging eith Oppo you don't get to see any ads or blotware, which is great.Secondly, I didn't face any issues while launching apps, the screen is super smooth and the ram management is too good. Even after hours of apps running in the background you can continue from where you left. One problem I would like to point out is that the fingerprint is not up to the mark, it takes several tries to unlock but the face unclock is too good, and even there's no headphone jack so you will have to purchase one type C to headphone jack connector.  Thirdly, the camera quality is too good even in low light it manages to capture jaw dropping pics, I am a bit disappointed with video as rhey could have done better by giving us the option to record 4K 60fps bit even now it is pretty good and the video stabilisation is very ggood in comparison to the devices which are in same price segment.Lastly, the battery life is okay-ish as I am a heavy user with a minimum screen time of 8 hours a day, sometimes I need to charge it 2 times a day while using the 90 Hz refresh rate, but the charger balances everything as it can charge upto 98% for 0 in just 30 minutes!!! which is quite amazing.To conclude, I would say that there are even better options in the same price segment but this product is worth investing in, so do shortlist this one if you are planning to buy a cellphone with a budget of 30K and yes there's a bit of heating issue while doing heavy tasks but I didn't feel that it's heared to a level that it would blast. To see extreme heating test I would prefer you Tech Bar's Oneplus Nord 2 Extreme Heating Test to make things more clear.Thank you."
125,Pulkit Gupta,Amazing phone with great user experience,5.0,18,11,2021,1,3,"I have been using this phone for a month now and loved it. The camera quality is really good, finger print scanner, sound, battery life, responsiveness all great. It can charge from 0-100 in 15 mins. But the best part about OnePlus is the User experience, how easy they make operating the phone.The gestures for frequently done stuff are amazing - torch, screenshot, awake. Even when unlocking, you can choose 2 apps for quick access. Let's say you PayTm very frequently, you can set it up in a way that you can directly launch it while unlocking.The back gesture is amazing, makes one handed usage so much more convenient.This phone is several notches above any other phone in this price segment or even some higher ones."
126,PIYUSH MISHRA,This is My First One Plus Series Phone. I switch from Oppo to One plus,5.0,17,8,2021,1,3,My First One Plus Series Phone. I switched from premium Oppo phone to One Plus Nord 2.I have choosed this because of their cameraand so happy that it still not disappoint me.Battery backup is also good last entire day for moderate users i can't say for gamers.65w charger is turbo fast it charged phone 100% with in 45min from 5to 100%.Processor is also good but face lock feature is disappointing.In some cases we forced to use finger lock or password.Over all its good in 35k range phone.Look is so attractive and we can go for this in premium android section.
127,Rahul Dixit,Amazon Is bluffing there customers. Not a fair deal from Amazon,4.0,24,10,2021,1,4,"I'm 70% satisfied with the product. It's good mobile. Quick charging is the USP of the mobile, bluetooth configuration is not so good. Along with that, touch sensor is not fast, it responds really very slow while unlocking the phone. I'm also not satisfied with the deal I got from Amazon. It showed me the actual price of the product as 34,999. And gave me a discount in prime deal and the final price was 29,999. But when I received the box, I was shocked to see the MRP of the product is 29,999₹. So Amazon bluffed me and several users by showing offers and sold out the product on its actual price. It's actually not fair. I trusted Amazon alot,but they betrayed a lot of users by bluffing each and everyone using the application.*I REQUEST ALL THE USERS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE... CROSS CHECK THE DISCOUNTED PRICE OF AMAZON WITH THE ACTUAL MRP OF THE PRODUCT YOU PURCHASE. IT MIGHT HAPPEN THAT YOU ARE BLUFFED ON THE NAME OF GOOD OFFER AND DISCOUNT.*"

Looks.6. And yes, the so-called OnePlus standard.Disliked:1. Price, it is overpriced.2. Poor build quality, chrome started leaving the paint after 2 weeks. While I am using its default cover and screen guard.3. It catches too much dust and fabric particles. This is the only phone that needs cleaning after every out of pocket. Its screen attracts dust and fabric particles.4. Fingerprint sensor is less sensitive. Sometimes it takes 2 sec. to unlock the device.5. Face unlock happens even when your face is covered with a mask.6. Battery drains faster. When we compare other devices with the same configuration, its battery drains faster."

131,Tanvi,Good phone but bad sound quality,3.0,29,7,2021,1,4,"Short one day review for Oneplus Nord2 8GB/128Phone works very smoothly, no lagsBattery drains at a normal rateWarp charger (65W) charges the phone 100% in 25mins-1/2 an hourGood camera - needs to be checked outside to know moreNo audio jackseparate button on right side of the phone for alerts - adjust phone on Silent/ Vibrate/ GeneralPhone is a bit heavyFingerprint sensor works properly, no lagsSound is sufficiently loudOverall a good phoneWhat i didn't like is the sound quality.  When I listened to music through the earphones i felt unpleasant and it was piercing my earbuds and the experience was very bad. Although everything else is good but the bad sound quality is what I can't bear with. One plus has compromised on the sound quality for this phone"
132,HEMANT SHARMA,First day review: Buy now; regret later,3.0,1,11,2021,1,2,"Day one : Instant regretIs there anything to like about this phone?I don't know if I've been scammed or oneplus has deteriorated. The only reason I bought this phone was camera.I had Poco F1 (adware and bloatware cleared) and Nord 2 stands no where close to F1. I went thru a series of traumatic episodes while clicking thru the camera modes and it's results. Immediately I applied for return but there poped up several clauses for item brought thru exchange. Now I have no option but to sit and cry for the wrong decision I made. And yes!! this phone plugged in for charging can evaporated my tear drops as well. Play heavy games and  turn this phone into heater.Things I like on this phone:Smooth scrolling.Oxygen OS is clean though.Phone case included.Overall: Don't buy, not kiddingEdit: An explode incident is circulating in social media. This phone heats up dangerously. I wish I could get a refund."
133,Sridhar,DEFINITELY GO FOR IT UNDER 30K.,5.0,15,11,2021,1,3,Under 30k gives you the best flagship experience. Battery lasts 17 hrs as said Camera quality is superb. The only issue you might want to be concerned is with the recent blasts of the phone but be assured it is most likely due to lack of how to use the 65W warp charger. It is very fast which charges 90% in 20 mins. So heat is generated. Advised not to overcharge or use phone when charging. If you keep safety as priority then go forr MI 11x
134,Vivek,Awesome phone in this price segment,5.0,30,7,2021,1,4,"Worth your 29999The best part of this phone is charging it charged within 30 min. If you want to keep your battery healthy please charge phone between 15-20% To 85-90% never charge 100.This phone gives you the best charging speed,Camera awesome, 1200 AI equals to 870 SD, OIS WORKING PERFECTLYusing for last 4 days no issues were faced.Screen is really fluid as they said.Overall if you want to buy a phone with class in 30K and with exchangeJUST CLOSE YOUR EYES AND GO FOR IT."
135,Nifran,OnePlus x pac man edition,5.0,21,11,2021,1,3,This is the best OnePlus Nord 2 edition. After discount I got this phone for 34999 and it's worth it. The phone looks more premium than 9r and other Nord editions. Good battery pack up (after restricting background activities under battery app management I get around 6 to 7 hours screen on time). Camera during day time is does job and during time night it's good if you hold on the phone for longer time while you takes pics on night mode.
136,Anurag Uikey,Power packed and Value for money,5.0,28,7,2021,1,6,"Simply Flagship killer from One plus. Fast , smooth and flawless operating system. Decent camera and sound quality. Overall enriched with features and value for money. Thanks amazon for fast delivery."
137,Mohd Farooq Khan,Review Revised: Good Phone with Decent Value for Money,5.0,5,10,2021,1,2,"Returned first unit due to very poor battery (used to charge 2 times/day), now new one requires charging 1.5 days which is decent enough considering high end motherboard.PROS:1) Good for first time buyers of Oneplus series who have not used Canvas option in Always on Display2) Snappy phone with fast response due to Dimensity 1200 Chipset is superb but battery draining3) Supported by Quick Android updates4) Charging time due to WARP charging is super and generally charges in 40 mins +/- 5 minsKEY to charging: Even after full charge (100%) it require some more charging and only when it shows Charged, only then discharge (Check Battery section and observe status)CONS:1) Battery life is never been its forte however WARP Charge fill this gap by providing extremely fast charging (BTW my second model (after returning first unit) providing better battery backup 1 to 1.5 days for complete discharge.2) Battery is 4500 mAH plus but it is good for nothing and charger is of huge size actually people should put the photo of charger and then understand how impossible to carry this abnormally big charger everywhere.3) Abnormal charging rate, sometimes takes 30 mins, sometimes takes 40 mins, sometimes even taken 50 mins. On top of it WARP charging really deteriorates the battery and ultimately kills it before its half life.4) No doubt it is color OS and not Oxygen OS (which is just pasted as skin on top of Color OS) so the unique charm of having Oneplus mobile is somehow gone after merger with OPPO"
138,TechSavvy,Not As Expected from 1+,3.0,3,9,2021,1,2,"OnePlus Nord 2 Vs Poco F3Day 3:So I watched lot of videos before finalizing for this one. All videos said that Poco F3 and 1+ Nord are same with minor differences.So as 1+ sound far better name and brand than poco, I decided to go for 1+. I have been 1+ fan since 1+1 launch.Verdict: Poco F3 would have been better.  (As I used F1 for 3 years & previous 1+1 & 1+6).Issues:Finger print sensor is slowCamera quality is good but macro & zoom focus is very badFace recognition rarely worksPhone is biggerPhone battery works for a day only (same as poco F1)Positive:Security seems betterNo irritating advt. Poco always seems to keep reading my data including contactsAuto unlock at home is good featureCharging is fastBottomline:If you want better brand name  : OnePlusIf you want better overall phone: Poco F3Edit: After 3 months of usage:Poco or other brand would have been better.- Google assistant doesn't work on lockscreen- if open mobile at night, it's too bright for sometime and then reduce the brightness- Bluetooth connectivity issueChasing OnePlus for support, but no response"
139,Shubhajit Roy,All Rounder,5.0,19,8,2021,1,2,"Everything works very well. I just have some issues which are as follows:1. front camera, kinda hazy sometimes.2. Change of accent colors requires a bit more options.3. Monochrome sensor is good for nothing 😂, could have given a macro there.Although most of the improvements can be done via updates.(*can't change the camera sensor though). So overall, a very promising device.I personally opted for this device because I used to own OnePlus 3 and it worked for 5 years. And I have other devices like earbuds, TV of OnePlus as well. Along with that, OnePlus gives me good customer service and frankly, it listens to the customer. Many a times I asked OnePlus for a feature in my OnePlus 3 and it was given in the updates.(*others also asked for it). Because of all these reasons I felt OnePlus Nord 2 is a very good device for its price."
140,Denver Saldanha,"Phone is great, but read before you buy!",5.0,29,7,2021,1,3,"The phone is great performance-wise. The battery is average, but the 65W fast charging will surprise you. The front camera is a 32mp camera but isn't good under low light conditions. Back camera is good enough!If you just want great performance with good enough battery that will last you a day and you are not a selfie addict then go for it! It wont disappoint you. Design is also really good and premium"
141,Sandeep,Premium phone at reasonable price,5.0,4,8,2021,1,2,"One plus team has really done a good job, really appreciate the premium look and finish at first glance. Fabulous camera at this price point, amazing oxygen os experience, better speakers. Yes, the phone does get a bit warm but nothing uncomfortable. Double thumbs up!!After a couple of days of usage.1. Face unlock is just top notch.2. Fingerprint reader might be slow by a fraction of a millisecond but I really don't mind.3. I can bet that it has one of the best camera in this segment.4. Awesome performance. I tested the new chipset on a lot of games (bgmi, cod, nfs) at high settings and I didn't see any frame drop anytime.5. I didn't feel a need for a120Hz display as it offers a silky smooth and super responsive display. Didn't really face low brightness issue outdoors.6. Warp charging this phone is a whole new level of experience and is probably the fastest in phones at this price point. Battery drains a bit sooner but it's absolutely justified for a device of such capability.7. I've used the in box cover so it helped block the heat during long hours of usage. Hopefully, the issue would get resolved with future software updates.Worth it!!"
142,Sanat T,Decent phone.,3.0,4,8,2021,1,2,"Got the 12GB ram variant. This is a decent phone. My previous phone was OnePlus 5T and coming from that I feel like this phone is kind of a disappointment. The width of the phone is a bit too thin for my liking but whatever. Another thing i hate is the software but in my defense i didnt know it has gotten this bad since then though.For pros, I love the buttons feel very clicky and responsive. The 65w charger is amazing, my laptop also uses a 65w type c charger so I don't have to carry extra charger around. The alert slider is easy to slide compared to the 5T but I got used to it. Haptic feedback is much better as well.Overall a bit disappointed especially in software and width of the phone, everything else feels good."
143,Naveen,Worth it,4.0,28,7,2021,1,8,"Camera is not up to the mark, performance wise it's extraordinary phone"
144,Anil Kumar Singh,Never Go for this variant,1.0,17,8,2021,1,3,"Very disappointed with the kind of mobile device provided by One Plus. I understand this is not their flagship product but at least it should be good enough to suffice our day-to-day needs when it is being priced at 30K. Issues that I have faced with this phone:1. Slide-up functionality is not working from the home screen.2. Defective microphone provided. It only works when I switch to a phone speaker.3. Frequent loss of mobile network and unable to connect calls. It gets resolves only I re-start my phone.Did not get much support from Amazon also. From the day I purchased this phone, it took almost 10 days for Amazon to understand that this is a defective phone that they have provided. I followed up with them on daily basis and have to be on call for at least an hour in order to make them understand the issue. And after all this pain they have not refunded the complete amount. I have exchanged my previous phone and did not get the full refund of it as it was non-refundable.Key points:1. Never go for One Plus Nord 2.2. Amazon will make you crazy in order to get a refund. (If replacement is not available)"
145,Raviteja,Only for working professionals,5.0,29,7,2021,1,2,"Good mobile, but not up to the mark with the price tag 30k not worth.I feel my privious mobile Nokia 8.1 was more premium than this OnePlus Nord 2.This mobile is for long term, after using for 2 days I feel after few software updates we get to know how exactly the it perform.I have used it at a stretch watching YouTube contact at HD, FHD and 4K, and with contact reading, attending the calls, going through the specifications, and doing with all the daily stuff it gave me battery about 8+ hour on screen time and chargers within 40 minutes from 0 to 100.Coming to pros and cons,Pros:1) Built Quality and design, simple and elegant(Strictly for working professionals).2) Touch very smooth.3) Camera, picture and video quality is very good.4) Stereo Speakers very loud and clear.5) Call quality is very good.6) Battery lasts for good 8+ hour on screen time.7) Charges very fast within 40 minutes.8) Played few games Asphalt 9 really gave me good feel.9) Ram management was good.10) Bluetooth connectivity is quite fast.11) 2 years OS updates and 3 years software updates.Cons:1) Sometimes heats even with normal usage(it may clear with software update)2) I don't feel the processor is really that powerful, MD 1200 AI it's not up to the mark on this device.3) It takes lot of time to boot when it gets restart, loading the games or apps.4) Not for heavy gamers, please avoid if you are thinking to buy it for playing games.5) Benchmarks are really very poor on this device when I had checked with my mobile, kindly check what OnePlus team had mentioned while launching this mobile(check picture attached)Over all this is a value for money if you buy it for long term like 3 to 4 years usage.Check my Nord 2 battery over on attachment.This is my 2 days experience only, it may varied user to user."

151,Nitin,A well balanced phone,5.0,15,8,2021,1,3,"This phone has a very good balance of all the features.1. Camera : Camera is good with nice colour reproduction. Photos come out clean and it's dependable in low light conditions as well.2. Battery : Battery backup is decent, not the best of all but it's good enough for an average person. A fast charging is always good to have and it charges in 20 minutes from 20 percent to 80 percent which is the average charging circle for me.3. Screen : 90 Hz screen is actually more than enough for an average user like me. Backed up with good haptics, it makes the experience good.4. Connectivity : 5G is certainly something which we will see later but for now it supports Career aggregation. Call quality is not right there as my iPhone but much better than average android phones.5. Speakers : It's like a mini soundbox. Truly loved it's speakers.Alert slider is a cherry on top.With a dependable service centres and a good software.It's the best phone out there at 30000. Go for it without a doubt."

(Bill attached)Bad experience with this from the moment it was received.Mobile hangs and slow during the initial startup.Device not working properly and restarts several times automatically.App clone is not working and I have the apps on my mobile. It is mentioned in the app clone but it doesn't show anything to clone.Normal whatsapp chat drive backup not working... My old whatsapp backups are gone😡😡😡.It was a Very bad and worst experience with a OnePlus..Photo access from the gallery is very slow.

Fast charging- it's charge really fast but  if u touch ur phone back it is super hot.2.) Heavy usage can effect the performance and heatup the phone3.) Camera is really good from other phone but wide angle and primary phone is not as well4.) Don't use this phone during charging or after changing at least 5 mins"

After a vigourous use i thought to review this phone some how as it actually blew my mind.First is the screen ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Damn impressed. I dont know the process rate but its damn responsive and fast. Very Good. Big enough to enjoy any video. The pixel clearity and the brightness will definitely fall you in love with this handset.Then comes the Sound quality. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Gives a crispy clear, balanced & surround sound. And the volume is LOUD.The Battery charger ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ one gets a 65 watt charger with in the box and its damn fast. My first 100% charge took 20 mins from 38%Camera ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Lovely digital and video captures. Outstanding. Ultimate clearity both in day and night. Obviously not as pro like but definitely not less than that.Interface ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ clean and easy. Took me minutes to get used to eat.Battery ⭐⭐⭐⭐ is amazing, does not drains fast, but this some what wont please hardcore gamers. Watching daily series on this or doing daily chores are perfect with this kind of battery.Phone cover & Tampered Glass cover ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ comes along with a rough and tough signature one plus cover and a pre-fixed tampered glass.8GB Rom 128GB RAM ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐No heating at all ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Over all im bowled with One Plus handset again. No more iphone for me again my life for sure. This the best smartphone for sure ♥️♥️♥️♥️"
159,Amazon Customer,Expensive But totally Worth It,5.0,3,11,2021,1,1,"So firsofall I am not gonna give a review the way those youtubers give. I am just gonna give a honest review which a lay man (non-techy) person can understand.The phone, battery life, display, processor and camera performance is just beyond par excellence. There is no phone that gives you this type of performance. Even the Oneplus 9R and Oneplus 8 are not this good.The highlight is the 65W charger which charges your phone to 100% in just 15 minutes. The phone is sturdy and looks great in your hand. Camera at 50 mp and Selfie with 32 mp is just amazing. There is no issue of phone heating up or any smartware or bloatware as such.Now let me come to the bad part.When you start your phone, it asks for permissions on all apps including your camera and your gallery, which means they (china) have access to all your pictures so you are risk of photos getting viral.Also you have to give permission to view data/pictures/chats else the camera/whatsapp will not work. If you read the conditions carefully is also says that Oneplus in HQ (China) can share this data/pictures with whomever they want and you can't hold this against them. So this is the scary part which I didn't like.Do remember to check the Oneplus Nord 2 review video on youtube posted by geeky ranjit. He has done an in dept analysis about the pros and cons of the phone.Honestly I dint wanna go for a Chinese brand and was deciding between Oppo Reno 6 which is priced at little lesser at 29,990/- but I thot for a little more money if I am getting phone which will last me for a good 5-6 years then why not put in an investment. With Oppo I wasn't sure about the durability.You can go for it if you have the budget of 35K but make sure you don't save any private pics in your gallery."
160,Isha,REVIEW after using for 15days,1.0,16,8,2021,1,2,"I bought 12gb ram model. Writing this review after using phone for 15days.I dnt think this is flagship killer, it should be treated equivalent to mediocre to redmi phones. I hvae also bought note10 pro max  at sametime for family. Comparing to that I dnt feel the price OnePlus charge is justified.- Camera is really bad. It over saturate the image and processing makes photos look really bad.Note10 pro max camera stands out and it really has flagship camera.This is where OnePlus lagged largely.30k phone with camera like 10k phone.- Only criteria where it excels is battery charge 65w, but that is now coming with basics phone within 20k price band.33w od other redmi phone is also not bad.-And gaming people can buy nord2 but personally I still donot prefer mediatek anytime above Snapdragon.- Speakers and display , nothing special looks same like any other amoled display in any ordinary phone.- No 3.5mm jack, learn from redmi and realme how to fit in best way.-Now all that 5g noise, does anyone think they are going to keep this phone for 3-4years waiting for someone to launch 5g. We are still not able to use 4g or 4g+ to  benefit.Why pay premium for feature you will probably never use.Take informed decision..."
161,Elite Engineer,OnePlus bomb,1.0,8,11,2021,1,8,Don't buy this scary device
162,Pritam Sadhu,Could be better if they improve battery section,4.0,30,8,2021,1,1,Using Nord 2 5G almost 1 month and here is my feedback:I am very happy with this device except the battery. Battery of 4500 mAh is not good at all though you will have 65W charger which can charge in 35 mins. But that will reduce your battery life cycle count.Initially there were lot of software bugs but I have received 3 updates in a month and almost all gone.For the Netflix  no HDR support there. HDR+ available on YouTube. Here Netflix needs to add this in supported device list.Call Quality is perfect.VoLTE working fine for Vi and AirTel and VoWiFi also working for Vi and Airtel.Rear camera is superb but front could be better but not major issue.120 Hz screen refresh rate is missing in this budget may be that is for 9Rt.
163,Kartick Hazra,Not So better and useful from Past Honor 15 k Phone,3.0,18,10,2021,1,2,"After using one month I am just Going to mentioned that my Honor 8x was too good compare to this phone software and few hardware (except added Hardware)1. No NPU unit its really unexpected2. When wifi enable voice call is just worst and breaking voice3. Call quality is not so good over Cell and 4G compare to my Honor 8x was far excellent4. UI Customization not good compare to my Honor 8x was far excellent5. No Customize animation on UI on screen slide6. On screen Fingerprint has no 360 activated feature that can unlock from any angle where compare to my Honor 8x was doing the same from back finger touch and fast7. Cannot block app network usage from background  individually8. Photo Glary has no many feature like pop up menu details even hanging9. Vivid color and display not like Actual Amoled screen type except refresh rate because in day out not so much brighter on direct sunlight10. Front camera  lagging with displayIts not like a 35K phone its just like a 15k Phoneand the brand taking all money without quality check as expected on this PricePlease stop doing business  in India by selling your Product with this someOne+ must have to look on thisAn the customer  service people only knows to reset the phonethat should no be the good practice , they must escalate to the developer and technical about the product review from customer to make it far better  and service"

166,Vanshika,Pretty much everything you can ask for,5.0,27,12,2021,1,2,"I've been using this phone from last four months and I now finally decided to write a review about it. Before you proceed to read my review, here's something you should know, if you're looking for a good aesthetic phone, go for it. I'm a minimal user. My main requirements were photography and smooth performance. I don't play games or perform heavy duty. I do basic reel editing. And I believe this was the perfect phone I could get. It's a full package. It gives instagram ready shots. The night shots are just supreme. I might as well rate its night photography above day one. For a basic user like me, it's a win. The front camera is a charmer too. This is my first ever experience with OnePlus and I'm not disappointed at all. Though I was little suspicious amidst blasting cases but then again I've been using it for four months and it is doing really well so I don't fear about it anymore.My advice? If you're basic user like me who wants good aesthetic shots, go for it."
167,Ramesh Babu,Didnt like the O.S at all >Review after a month,3.0,2,9,2021,1,1,"I was waiting to buy this phone in first sale bcoz of the hype over its features and finally got it. And im really surprised why people are crazy abt oneplus phones. The O.S is not tht great and not so user friendly. the basic things like1) Dialer app - there is no full screen image coming for incoming callers. if u want to search for a contact  U need to scroll down to go to specific alphabet  or u need to search in search bar.There is no side bar with alphabets given  where u can directly jump to the specific alphabet in contacts app.2) messages - im unable to find whether the message came from sim 1 or sim 2 & also u need to long press to change sim1/sim2 to send a message.3) calculator is pretty basic without any converters like currency,date,age ,speed etc.4) there is no automatic call recording option. if u press call recording after a call starts, it will say automated voice to both callers "" this call is being recorded'' .which is shocking5)Battery drains faster for normal usage without even playing games. however it takes only 30 mins for 0-100 % or u just need 10 mins if u have 40% already which is big plus.6) 32 mpx front camera with sony sensor is not really great. i have redmi note 5 pro which deliver better selfies than this.back camera is ok with HDR. without HDR it makes skin wrinkly. i wonder why??7) on whatsapp video calls front camera is not at all good. i have fiber net speed connection but it makes my face look very wrinkled, and noisy. No clear face is coming.. i dont know why :(8)Screen casting to my VU TV  is not working at all . im still trying, but it makes phone freezing and i need to exit from screencast everytime. Never connected to tv.  its  just me or everyone?? if u think these are all network issues, its running smoothly with my old redmi note 5 pro mobile !!!? so its something related to mobile issue only.And using same wifi for all devices.9) NO themes available other than the system provided. u need to apply 5-6 themes which are default or need to change the wall paper for new look.10) Appclone (Dual apps) available only for insta,fb,messenger,telegram & whatsapp. u cant use other than these apps.11) there is no call recording folder found in file manager.After searching 30 mins i finally  able to listen . why though???these issues are O.S related which were never discussed in any youtube channels they all reviewed looks specs.....but these things are always annoying me in my daily use... Small things but why should i worry always...after all its ONEPLUS.... THE BIGG BRAND... its definitely over rated in my opinion ."
168,Dr.Kaushik J,No value for money,2.0,8,8,2021,1,3,Very happy with the delivery by Amazon... hopeless battery...does not stay for even a day...fast charge gets to 100% in half hour but the 100% does not last even a day wit conservative use..makes me wonder if they're showing 50% as 100% in a make-believe operation....also the first news I read the day after buying the phone was about the phone explosion in bangalore...finally good luck trying to find a screen guard in the stores
169,Srabanjit Guha,"Pathetic performance. Major heating issue, no support from oneplus",1.0,3,10,2021,1,2,"Pathetic performance. Major heating issue, no support from oneplus..Have provided all debug report, necessary inputs to analyse the issue, not support from oneplus. Refer attached response after 1month followup.I have debugged by my own. Issues mainly in:1. GPU performance compatibility with processor.2. Over locked cpu caused over consumption of battery while using camera, videocall or net browse. Causing heating issue3. Lagging of power consumption optimization and 65w charger causes heat during chargeIf you still interested, after performing os update, go to advance settings and adjust refresh ratio to 90 hz and reduce GPU cycle. Switch off GPU performance logging and all other back end performance reporting logs. This actually may help you reducing the heating issue. But that's just a temp fix. OnePlus has to take care the problem seriously."
170,Areeb,Brilliant phone! Finally a good device by oneplus after launching pathetic phones like the 9 series,5.0,8,8,2021,1,4,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Great phone under 30k!!! Consider it if you want a value for money phone that meets all expectations! That feeling owning a oneplus is anyday better than owning an iqoo vivo oppo poco!! Oxygen os apparently has some funtouch os touches but trust me oxygen os still is alive which itself is a reason why I went for this device!!! Kudos to oneplus"
171,Aishwarya S.,Selfie cam is not up to the mark.,3.0,29,7,2021,1,4,"The selfie camera is disappointing. Desaturated pictures, smoothes out everything even after beauty filter is off. Not very sharp and not real colours. Main camera is very good."
172,Sagarkumar Pamula,Please don't buy a Mediatek Density SoC mobiles,1.0,12,8,2021,1,3,"OnePlus Nord 2 is accompanied with Mediatek Density 1200 SoC which is quite powerful in terms of organization producing it. I bought OnePlus Nord 2 (12GB RAM and 256 GB storage) through Amazon . I wanted to return this device but, the return policy for Amazon is 7 days only which made a loss of 9k for me. When it comes to performence first week was fine but, after 10 days it started showing its true nature. First, don't know why it started burning up at the processor side of the phone🔥. I thought of over usage may be but, I remember it neither I have used it to its maximum potential and also I am low key user. Second, while charging the device it started burning up again thought due to charging this happens but, I earlier used OnePlus 5, OnePlus 5T, Redmi Note 6 never faced such issue while charging and being a Mediatek Density SoC it shouldn't. Third, Ambient display feature is good but, drains your battery to a next level and the UI is not designed to show how much does this feature drains battery. Fourth, Proximity Sensors were not working at all which I got to know while I did a manual diagnosis of phone through OnePlus Care app. Conclusion: This phone is not at all a good choice for buying it with Mediatek Density SoC. If you have used Snapdragon then go for the same but don't buy Mediatek SoC mobiles at all. In the end I incurred a loss of 9k for getting rid of this phone through buy back feature which is a huge set back for android devices. Atleast OnePlus Center guys should have considered that device had issues but, the service center guy says with smile that we can't do anything submit your phone and take it back after 2 days. Any new phone buy back program should only reduce 20% of its initial price. This should be applicable to all devices in the country. Now, I own a Snapdragon 888 SoC OnePlus 9 Pro which is much more better than these low end version.Note: Please be aware of this never buy a budget phone because it is already compromised with the specifications and reduces it true value."

174,thulasidaran,"Great phone, impressive performance",5.0,17,10,2021,1,1,"Bought this as a long pending replacement.  Per initial experience, I am impressed.-battery: Lasts more than a day with moderate use- Camera: great quality pictures. No grains when zooming in-charging: 15% to 100% in 15 mins, no heating issue. In general there is no heating issue with continuous usage too, which is great.performance: apps load superfast, no lags, touch response is great, overall impressed.the silicon case supplied with phone is of decent quality-it's ribbed structure protects camera and the screen, tempered glass is preapplied, so no need to buy these separately as of now.Good buy, to sum up."
175,Faizan sheikh,Mobile is good but getting heat a lot,3.0,29,7,2021,1,2,"Monile is decent,runs smooth, display is good, charging is fastBut there are some cons which needs to keep in mind1. Software- trust me guys i was using oneplus 5 from last 4 year, but this nord software doesn't feel like you are using oxygen os, it feels cheap like other OS2) too much enhancement feeling cheap camera3) getting heat alot, if using continusly for more than hour it start heating, if charging from 20 to 70 percent back will get heat.Overall this phone is for normal and light user but for techy people, for mobile lovers this is not one plus you can rely on.OnePlus days are gone now, in this price segment even vivo 60 is far better doing than this, there's realme x7 too if we rewlly want that cheap software experience."

So this one was 6th One Plus phone, and probably our last one.Pros:OS : Simple and SnappyLags: None so farBattery charging: 100% in <30 minLooks are decentCons:1) Speaker quality. It seems that speaker is burst.2) Camera takes blurred photos if there is slight movement of the subject. This is the BIGGEST IRRITATION. Are people supposed to hold their breath?3) No 3.5 mm jackBut overall, I Can't find a difference in my One Plus 5 and this one. What has One Plus done in last 4 years? Stopped innovating completely."
177,Akash mandal,A good option under 30k,5.0,23,8,2021,1,3,"Bought 1st day, got a defective battery product, then replaced . Using it for 20 days, no issues as such except battery draining a bit faster, and nord 2 isn't as fluid as OnePlus Phones used to be. Even now Original Nord is more fluid than nord 2 , camera very good , but we don't need e 2mp camera instead give a little more battery or headphone jack or atleast give the adaptor. Had to buy it separately. In hand feel awesome display average and speaker is great, front camera needs improvement and should have 4k options, given case is made of great quality. Charging is good. Gaming performance is also good . Ram management poor, total 75 apps(without any games) there but ram free only 2.4gb, needs regular updates. Bought a skin from gadgedshieldz."

180,sachin sachdeva,Not a user friendly phone,3.0,14,8,2021,1,1,"Hi friends, i was using Samsung since very long time and this is my first phone other than samsung. The first impression was good and its been 20 days completed m using this phone and my experience is not very much good as the main issue is accessibility or usage which quite difficult . Also i didnt found any inbuilt app for daily workout like walking, step count ect. Call recording is also with warning only. Battery lasts upto max12 hrs so that is also not so good, although charging is very very fast and impressive but only with one plus warp chrger. With other chargers chaging takes normal time of 45-60 mins to full. While on call sometime its hang up and i 7nable to access other functions during calls that is very big issue. About camera picture quality is good but zoom and other functions are very typical to use. Also the gallery interface is very bad and difficult to see clicked or download pics.I bought 12gb and 256 gb version in 33k with cash back and overall its not value for money. I regreat after purchasing this phone and thete are so many other good options in this price. I decided to use this phone for 10-11 months as I downloaded so many official apps which require approvals and cannot be uninstalled quickly.For others who are planning for this phone, please check some other options also like Oppo reno 6 pro 5 G, samsung 5 G new series."
181,Siddharth singh,Best value for money product,4.0,16,1,2022,1,1,"Overall the phone is very good. For me, the camera quality is good and the battery lasts for a day with a single charge. The fast charging charges the phone within 25 minutes. The performance of the device is also good you can play most of the games without any lag. The handiness of the device is best and it is fun to use this phone for reading and along with a 90Hz display, it is a delight for the eyes. One thing I don't like about the device is that it does not provide call recording without announcement and I think it is a software privacy issue and the fingerprint reader does not work even if your fingers are slightly wet. Front-facing camera can be improved. Overall I am happy with the phone in 28k."

Haven't experienced any heating issue while using the phone. Since it's 65W charging you must expect some heating while charging which is normalThe main drawback - 120Hz refresh rate is not available at this price rate."

188,T BALA SRINIVAS,Camera and battery performance,3.0,3,8,2021,1,2,"Hi everyone,. Before I brought this brand mobile I was basically using MI brand for many years, my last phone was poco F1, I lost my poco F1 in a theft, so I was in a hurry to buy mobile.  My friends were using oneplus brand mobile previously and they were quite happy with the oneplus brand performance and camera performance. I have seen the photos of that oneplus brand mobile of my friends and was really happy with the performance of the photos and decided to buy oneplus brand.  I also have a realme x7 mobile in my home so I am comparing this mobile with  realme x7 as well as MI 11 x 5G Pro. The camera of realme x 7 and MI 11 x 5 Pro 5g quite superior and very clear compared to this one I am not happy with the camera performance of this mobile. The battery of  this mobile drains quite fast. The on-screen time when fully charged of this mobile is around only 6 hours. Realme x7 costs less when compared to nord 2. So I would suggest Everyone to buy realme x7 rather than this one which is costing 12000 less"
189,Virender,Keep Charging,1.0,31,10,2021,1,1,"I've always been a fan of one plus and purchasing the nord2 was an exciting part after using one plus 5 for 4 years.My recommendation to One Plus team is to stick to basics.Missed to mention, it heats like crazy.I charge Nord 2, 2 to 3 times a day. Can you believe that.Not sure what to do now.Rest everything comes after battery.It sucks, literally sucks.I'm writing the review at 2230 hrs and had charged the phone to 100% at 1800 hrs.So in 4 hrs 30 mins, battery remaining is 25%.Call is yours.My recommendation is to go only for core series like 8, 9.........................Review of 9 Nov:I tried to analyse the problem and reduced the screen refresh rate from 90 Hz to 60 Hz. This has helped and battery is bit stable after that but again does not last one full day.Phone is still getting heated up not as much when the refresh rate was 90Hz.My overall recommendation again will be to avoid this phone. You will get much better deals in this range."

191,ARUN GOSWAMI,Wonderful buy. Worth the price,5.0,8,8,2021,1,1,"The OnePlus Nord2 phone for me is worth the price. It's surely is an upgrade for me and though I was highly confused with so many reviews about phones in this range, I am glad I went for it.The battery is superb. I am a normal user (don't game much and watch and listen to music at a normal to high level and browse social media platforms every 2-3 hrs). The connectivity is good (bluetooth, wireless and network). I love the VoWiFi option (didn't have on my Oneplus5) and display is superb. Haptics are nice and charging is unbelievably fast. So for regular users like me this is surely an option in the top 2 or3 if you are looking to buy a new phone. OnePlus as a brand  is still worth spending a little extra for as of now."

It's camera is better than the Mi11x and Iqoo 7.Design: The grey siera matte design is great. It feels really good in hand and is perfect for the minimalist.OS: The OS is smooth, intrusive and easy to understand. Though there has been some changes with the addition with color OSKudos to amazon for its quick delivery.Cons:None so far, maybe the lack of headphones jackTo sum it up, its a great phone at this price point with its camera, os, and performance.

197,Sanjeev Kumar Boiti,A good upper budget smartphone with a lot of cheap parts.,3.0,16,12,2021,1,2,"After using it for around 3.5months i'm writing this review. Firstly,i would like to present you some of the pros that you get with your hard earned sweat flow money.1.The Usage- It was really good. Never hanged or never got over-heated. I'm not a heavy user but once played COD for around 1.5hrs but didn't see any significant change in temperature on the back panel nor on the screen and it ran smooth too.2.Battery life- Speaking about the power i must also mention how long it will last but i must say it really works good. In terms of battery if you are a non heavy user you can last upto 1day or even a day and some hours on the next one.3.Charging- This speed is really great and Oneplus does a great job here. You can get 35mins charging time for 1-98% but would recommend to always connect at 30% and disconnect 80-85% to have a long lasting battery .4.Camera- The most deciding factor for many, Oneplus really does a good job here too. The colours are really good and sharpness is also great. The video have a good stabilisation and colours are also great here. At a budget of 30K you can get the best camera.5.Screen- The screen quality is also good and the colours produced are also natural. I like a bit of saturated colours so have set the screen to vivid mode. Playing 4K videos on this screen is great. The brightness levels are also good for outside sun hours usage.6.Sound quality- Speaking the speakers, it really sounds loud and clear. The clarity is great if you use the Dirac Audio Tuner you can also tune according to your need by choosing the presets which really makes a difference on earphones and headphones. Bluetooth earphones doesn't support any kind of tuning from the smartphone.Now, soo much good comes with a lot of unexpected problems that no one could expect from an OnePlus smartphone.Cons:1.Servicing- Oohh,here Oneplus kills my Pros words. First ,after 3months the charging all of sudden started connecting and disconnecting automatically every 10secs and if stood connected would charge really slow say like 2hrs of charging for 20% to 90% and i went to service center for rectification. They said the cable is not working and said to come after 2hrs but after that again he said you come after 1hr and offered me a old cable washed with colin infront of me. The service person still had the audacity to say that this is a new one and asked me that its working or not as if i have asked him free cables . After a bit of quarrel finally he said after 2days it will be in stock and you will get it. After getting a new packed cable the problem still presisted.I went again after 9-10 and they said to change the motherboard and asked me to have a backup of the data on that. Finally the changing of motherboard solved the problem. But Dear Oneplus , if you are reading this is it so that Oneplus started giving up on their motherboards too?The day i got my device back, the alert slider is not working . It would be silent and vibrate but won't come back to general of clicked back and you have to reboot to make it back to General mode. Really Oneplus,Is this what one should expect from you atleast?The company whom i have known to have a great lasting time of around 4-5years and more is doing this to new smartphones?Its now mine also that the alert slider stopped working, my friend's Nord and OP7 also had same problems and they atlast exchanged for a new phone."

This phone gives all of it and more.The phone goes from 40% to 100% in about 15 minutes, and that's one feature I love - no need to put the phone on charge overnight. The phone charges fully while I finish my breakfast.Fingerprint sensor works in a jiffy, a distinct improvement from OnePlus 6T I have been using for last 3 years. The camera works great for me. I am not a gamer so cannot comment on the gaming aspects.Also it's lightweight and slim, and the speakers work just great.In summary a great choice at the price from OnePlus."

204,Pratik Kumar Sahu,Initial product review: OnePlus Nord 2 5G (Go For It),5.0,31,7,2021,1,2,Initial impression is good. Lot of granting permission in the beggining which might seems bit irritating.Apps getting crashed during uses due to storage issue.Little bit of heating issue was there at the beginning but now it is totally fine.There were some issue related to storage..everytime getting message : 'Clean up storage to download the apps from play store'.Even with all the glitches after doing one Factory Reset..everyting working fine now.Main Camera quality is crystal and mind-blowing. Front camera may be bit hazzy but still it do the work after some adjustment.Battery life is working quite well..played COD for more than an hour and battery consumption was only 18%. Pretty much does the work.No lag during game play.Overall UI is awesome.Value for money 💸💰..
205,Aji Apra,Pocket mode not working at all,2.0,16,1,2022,1,1,"Based on previous good experience with OnePlus bought this one ( even though it's from china!!).Now, i bought, set up, switched from old phone to this phone. Thought all sorted. I realised random calls were going, messages were getting sent etc. It's due to pocket mode not working !!Called customer care. They asking me to bring the phone for repair and it will take two weeks.Ridiculous. Please don't buy oneplus. This is simply not acceptable. They should've given a replacement phone and sold this as refurbished."

   Pros and cons after 1 month of use...1) Main camera is good, but u can't do touch to focus, focusing done only with camera sensor we can't do it touch to focus.2) Wide angle camera is not so good, it doesn't have stabilization.3) After 15-20 min of camera use you'll get overheating warning and then until phone get's to its idle temperature you can't use it.4) Battery backup I don't have any complaints, I am using it majorly for photography and gaming purpose, after 2 hrs of BGMI (PUBGM) gaming battery drains only 20-30%.5) If it comes to charging speed, you keep phone on charge and until you'll come back after bathing it charges fully... It means 25-30 mins it takes to charge 100%.6) Because of plastic and glass design device feels hot immediately.7) Front camera is just like 15k mobile camera, but I don't need it so no prob for me.8) OS is butter smooth with 90fps.*That's it guys, for photography clarification, check added clicks and follow me on instagram for new clicks and tutorials of Nord 2...❣️*"
207,Kunal C.,Most overrated and underperforming phone,1.0,16,10,2021,1,2,"I have been a big oneplus fan. Used their one plus 5 for 4 years. Never had any problems no lag, no problem of hanging, good battery life and a great camera quality. Then I started facing some software issues and bugs so I decided it was time to move on with times and get the one plus nord 2. It's been almost a month since I have been using this phone. And WHAT A LET DOWN. Horrible camera clarity. The brand seems to have regressed interms of its camera. I have never been so disappointed with a phones camera. And over all usability is also not very smooth despite the fact that I have a 12/256GB varient. The display clarity is also below average and a let down. Doesn't feel like a fluid amoled display at all. Video quality on 360p seem poorer than they should. Over all I would like to give them a ZERO especially for the camera, the screen quality and over all usability. Please don't waste your money. Might aswell buy the iPhone 11"

This phone is excellent but thing is 1+ oxygen OS is the reason I liked 1+ products. But in Nord2 I have to face some downgrades in OS like there is an Google dialer in this phone insted of OnePlus own dialer and same this happens with the messanger too which I hated most . Although I have no problem with changed camera UI because 1+ camera UI is not that great. Plus there were also not that much customisation as compared to my 1+6 but still this Nord device really performing well and works really smooth."
211,Lingaraj K P,Siddhi Baat No Bakwas,2.0,15,10,2021,1,2,Hard earned money spent on a waste mobile. I don't say I'm a big fan of Samsung but you get what you are looking for within your range. But this is completely disappointed me. Now I'm realizing I should have gone for a high end mobile from Samsung or a basic Mobile from Apple. I'm not at all thrilled to hold this mobile. Never again in my life. Samsung I'm extremely sorry.

213,Amazon Customer,Very bad buy,1.0,13,9,2021,1,2,"This is the second time in the last one and a half month when my phone got self locked and it's allowing only receiving calls and dialing emergency numbers. OnePlus customer care is completely deaf about the issues raised. Have again raised a pickup request for repair. Now it will come with a factory reset so, all data will be lost again.  There seems to be a software issue which OnePlus isn't able to fix. Final message for all: Never Settle for OnePlus Nord 2."
214,Ravindra Prabhu,Almost all the good stuff.,4.0,8,10,2021,1,1,"Well the phone is great. No two words about it. I switched over from a Poco F1 and this is what I felt is missing in the Nord 2 - automatic call recorder. I work in a job that requires me to take a lot of client calls and I record most of them for my reference to execute the work. This was never a problem with the poco F1 but the Nord 2 has Google dialer and make an announcement when you manually hit record and that spooks the other person. Next is the size of the phone, it's a bit taller than my old poco F1. There is no reason for a phone to be imagined as a phablet. A phone goes into our pocket and goes everywhere with us, so it should be handy. Manufacturers need to get over their obsession of making bigger phones."

So if you r planning to buy One Plus nord 2 for Rs.30000 then better don't waste your money to buy one plus nord. Because there are other brand also provide same kind of configuration in lower cost.Good thing is performance and its camera are impressive.
217,Priyank ji,Best phone at this price,5.0,31,8,2021,1,1,Thankyou so much Amazon for selling One plus phone . Genuine product with good packaging.Likes1- Battery charges from 3 to 100 % in just 30 mins.2- Camera quality best in the class3- Anytime better than samsung or oppo phones. Samsung doesn't stand near in User experience.4- One plus has best touch experience.improvementBattery life is around a 24 hours with average use.Pre-installed apps like auto call record not present.
218,Amazon Customer,Lots of issues,3.0,4,8,2021,1,2,"This is my first One Plus phone and I'm two minds about it, it's been over a week of usage now, some places it has impressed me and some places it js straight up disappointing. I just noticed that it has stopped fast charging, I don't know why. It was working till today morning and today evening I decided to charge my phone and it took 3 hours to full charge, the battery is draining relatively quickly as well. There is no gaming mode in this phone so gamers please don't buy this phone, unless you want pop up interfering with your gameplay. The only good (decent) part about this phone would be camera which is decent for the price. Apart from that, idk, wouldn't recommend you to buy this phone. Can go for an Iqoo 7 instead. Bought that as well, worth every buck"
219,ankit b.,A kind of premium flagship killer,4.0,28,10,2021,1,1,"Overall the phone is quite outstanding.Camera is amazing (but that OnePlus camera app missing , you get a color os camera app which is just ok)Battery is satisfactory. For me it lasts about 18 19 hrs (which includes around 1 hr of gaming playing call of duty and vlash of clan)with a screen on time of 5-6 hrs which is decent.Charging is mesmerizing 🤩. 0 to 100 in 31mins. This is the best part of this phone. Drain it as much as you can and charge it for just 15 min you will get enough to sustain 5 6 hrsCall quality is good with proximity sensor properly workingStereo speakers will amaze you. Best i would say in this price.Screen experience vould have been even better we get 120 hz display but 90hz is ok."
220,Sreejith & Lakshmi,"Recommended, if you could live without a 2.5mm headphone jack",5.0,17,12,2021,1,0,"Enough had already been said by others that by now you must be knowing all the pros and cons of this device. It is not a mind boggling phone or a design benchmark , but a very good phone that fits most of the pockets, figuratively. It perfectly suits my daily needs- reading news, messaging, video calls , banking ....4 to 5 hours of screen time every day . Yes, it does tend to heat up, noticed while updating apps in a go and while making prolonged video calls. I keep the WiFi  and the mobile data on always, bluetooth off and with my usual usage 25-30% charge will be left by night. It doesn't have a 'monster' battery that lasts 2-3 days on single charge, but who needs that when you could charge the phone to 85% in 10 minutes , thanks to warp charging. And when you plug-in your device late in the night, it detects and switch itself to optimized night charging mode. Not an ardent photographer, but the photos taken were crisp and bright. Low light photography was also great. Not a fan of onscreen finger print scanner, but there is no lag in unlocking . Even face unlock works like a charm. Another plus point, in my perspective, is that the device is very handy and light weighted too. I don't know anything about the 5G capabilities and the so called band controversies, I am happy with what I got. Ask me, I would say you should buy this, if your average screen usage is less than 5 hours a day , not a hardcore gamer and if you don't have to take an emi or loan to buy this phone. Thank you for putting through"

Phone heat like oven, while using camera/video it feels like its gonna explode soon. that much of heat  coming out from the phone.2. Mist coming around camera.!!  After say 5-10 mts of usage, there's a cloud of mist coming inside the camera, and after that, all the  pics we take look blurry.  I've attached the photo of it. have a look at it3. Lame Customer care!!  I made a complaint to customer care, and they couldn't solve the issue, they said they had to change the  motherboard and ruined the phone completely. I'm gonna file a case in consumer court. Their handling was awful, I got scratches and switch damages.  Verdict!!!  Don't buy this phone at any cost. I won't recommend this crap phone to anyone, Don't waste your hard  earned money on it."
223,Shivam,"not a value for money product, expected better camera and battery life",2.0,30,8,2021,1,2,"I'm writing this review after using the mobile for a month. This is my very honest opinion.Earlier I was using Redmi Note 5 Pro. The main reason I bought this product for its processor and camera. My review might contain some comparison b/w my last low budget phone (10k-20k) to this mid budget phone (20k -35k).Pros:1. No ads2. Super Fast charging is very good: With in-box charger, it took half an hour for full charge. But this will only work with oneplus warp charger. The mobile also supports slow charging (better for battery life) with in-box charger, but there is no option to use/set it manually, it is auto, mostly at night time.3. Night mode works good, just you need to hold it for 4 seconds.4. Primary rear camera is very good, but other two rear cameras are just for display.5. 90 Hz display is good.6. Small onscreen button in corner for screen rotate function which appears automatically in bottom when it is needed.7. Slider to change to ring/vibrate/silent. A nice feature.8. The processor is fast enough for me, but I can't say for others as I'm not heavy gamers or video editor.9. UFS 3.1 storage is fast for file transfer b/w pc and mobile10. Onscreen fingerprint is more convenience.Cons:1. Battery life is short. For normal users, you might need to charge it twice. So I think it is not suitable for travelling.2. Selfie camera is 32M, but selfie photos looks like low budget phones. BIG disappointment for me.3. Secondary rear camera can be better. Third (2M) rear camera is useless.4. Boot time is high.5. Peak brightness is low. Only issue if you stay in sunlight for longer time.6. Although there are no ads, but you can not remove pre-installed google apps. like youtube (okay for me), youtube-music, google duo, google play movies, google photos. I would prefer to remove them.7. App clone is sh*t compared to what I used in my last Redmi phone. Only support for few apps like whatsapp, facebook, telegram, but also I cannot access their data folder. I need to access my cloned whatsapp folder which I used to backup data to my laptop using USB cable in case needed.8. Sometimes it hangs too. I noticed it when using the camera. I hope they fix it with future update.9. Calling app is not good.  a. warning for call record, tried multiple apps but nothing works; also other Oneplus phones are snapdragon based, so their apk can not be installed in Mediatek based nord-2 . now I have stopped using call recording.  b. if you use video call feature( which can be used when calling b/w same sim operator), you won't like it. very small round block of your video (you can not know exactly what other is seeing) and that too is fixed in left corner. Cannot hide it or focus on it,  c. if phone gets locked while calling, you cannot use fingerprint till you are in call as no option to see onscreen fingerprint sensor to place your finger. You can only use calling function else you need to cut call and unlock and then call again.10. I feel in-built apps like Gallery, file manager and others have very limited and basic function.11. whenever I try to access my whatsapp folder, it takes significant time to show content of my images/videos in whatsapp media folder. That was not the case with my last redmi phone. Both whatsapp are of same size (6GB).12. Once I gave my bluetooth earphone to service center. I felt mobile should have 3.5mm jack, also oneplus type-c wired earphone are too costly (Rs 1300) where as you can get 3.5mm good earphone in Rs 500.I hope it would help others to make a good decision."
224,Amazon Customer,It's Ok,3.0,5,8,2021,1,2,Now a days anyone fight for their investment. At the rate of 30k OnePlus Nord should perform better than other competitors. People don't need brand. They need quality with their investment. OnePlus satisfied but not surprised. I'm giving overall verdict that best performer with best built quality of phone and charger but not battery. Roughly used mobile users are not preferred this cute mobile. But it's preferred like psychopaths.
225,GK,Excellent Mobile Phone - Oxygen OS fans find some difference,5.0,8,9,2021,1,0,"Pros: 6GB/128GB Variant1. Excellent display without any tint issue like other AMOLED display2. Build quality is good but always glass is a glass, rear will easily break even-though Gorilla Glass 5 if you dropped at a small distance. Use with case to avoid scratches and to manage unforeseen drop.3. Stero-speaker is loud enough compared with the same mid-range of devices4. Much better camera optics compared with OnePlus 9R and OnePlus first generation Nord device, picture quality is very good in both day-light and night mode5. No heating issues observed even-though squeezing the phone through multi-task using many apps6. Google meet, Zoom calls and Slack/Huddle calls of both Audio & Video working flawlessly for quite long time without facing any heating complaints7. Battery backup is good in which SOT getting around 6HRS to 7HRS which is fair enough in this segment8. Charging speed - no words to highlight here as everyone aware the power of warp charge with 65 watts adapter9. Finger-print is speed enough which is far better than any Samsung mid-range devices10. Voice clarity is excellent - using both Jio and Airtel11. Voice over Wi-Fi working flawless if the bandwidth is enough or else facing minor lag in the opponent voice12. Picking network signals is very good compared with few Mi phones in the same network zone13. Same case for picking Wi-Fi signal compared with other mid-ranger smartphones (Wi-Fi 6 supported)14. Network Aggregation kicked-off without any issue, able to see increase in the download speed from 19mbps to 30mbps  - Kudos to Mediatek Dimensity 1200 AI15. No issues in touch sensitive of this AMOLED display which is very good16. Form-factor and weight balance is nice, which is easy to hold in hands compared with other 6.4+ inches mobile devicesCons:1. Minor change in the OxygenOS which is now acts as a wrapper UI because of core code base is changed to ColorOS from their parent company of Oppo (Little bit long list start from battery section to permission section)2. Sometimes facing minor issue in proximity sensor - not all the times3. Auto-brightness taking brightness to low level sometimes4. Always on display is taking battery consumption upto 5% to 7% additional juice"
226,MOZAMMIL ANSARI,"Think before purchase, Is only Brand Name enough for Purchase",3.0,6,8,2021,1,3,"I am Realme XT (Snapdragon 720) user from last 02 year, after accidental damage of my phone, I go with huge Brand Name OnePlus, phone color, look is simply awesome, but battery drain is so fast after 30 mint of simple insta and Amazon my battery is 98-68, if u are multipurpose or heavy user then U have to charge ur phone at least 2 time and some time 3 times , and phone hitting is really serious issue, Only use of YouTube or Insta u can feel phone heat at the external cover"
227,Ankur Thakur,Best than the others in this price range,4.0,24,11,2021,1,0,"I've been a OnePlus user for 4 years now. This purchase is my upgrade from 5T.Here is my review after three weeks of use:- Rear camera is surely good, the night mode feature is just amazing. It's better than a lot of other smart phones in this bracket.- Front camera is only 8MP and hence isn't that great.- Battery life isn't huge. Although my usage is heavy, but not extremely heavy, still it lasts 1.5 days only. It could have been better. Fast charging feature is just out of this world. It takes only 30-35 minutes to get your phone fully charged from zero which is just amazing- screen refresh rate is very good and the display is as smooth as it gets- rest all other features are similar to my previous OnePlus 5T, nothing new in thereOverall, it's a good buy and from my past experience of using OnePlus, I can definitely say that this phone will last for at least 3-4 years with you."

Display is crisp 90Hz is smooth.3. Phone is Fast, you won't feel any lag4. Aah camera, the sony sensor sucks all the light into it. Trust me nord 2 has the best low light camera out there in the segment.5. Warp charge is crazy, 10-90% in 13 minutes, its insane.6.

229,Aanal shah,"Perfect under ₹30,000",5.0,2,2,2022,1,0,"Price: Bought on republic day with instant discount of ₹3,000 so actual price is ₹27,000.Phone weight : even though it's 190g it doesn't feel that.Display : i always looking for small display size, my previous phone was redmi note 7 pro, but compare to that even though screen size slightly larger than that phone but I don't have any problem. Display color is awesome, no complaints.Camera : main back camera is the main thing which is excellent. Even though I like front camera also but some of my friends is not happy.Battery : i was concerned about battery life but it's also more than sufficient for day usage. Be aware while charging phone it's just take only 14 minutes from 15% to 100%, charger is very fast.You can't insert memory card in this phone.Overall best phone of if you are looking to switch in premium brand."
230,Sagnik ghosh,Performance,4.0,14,8,2021,1,2,"I have using this nord 2 for past  six days I can say the performance of this phone is good but not class leading when I played asphalt 9 i noticed several frame drops at high quality settings also 60 fps is not available in asphalt 9 .In terms of pubg the phone performes decent enough.At first when I received the mobile it has some heating issu but after three days of uses the  isuu got fixed automatically I don't know how it's happened and about the UI I don't know why they giving Google dialer and massaging app u just can't record any secret conversation and the flotting animation of that massaging app is trash it's so jittery . The fingerprint sensor of this phone is avarage , camera quality is good ,battery life is decent  overall a decent phone."

232,kranthik,Mobile is good to use few drawbacks,3.0,28,8,2021,1,1,I'm using OnePlus 6 device frm 2018 now nord2 few drawbacks with mobile I try to convey it to technician but they r operating over phone rather visiting when I'm on call speaker mode mobile screen going into sleep mode there z no way to wake the screen unless u click power button n end the call this is the biggest drawback n live streaming cc camera it's showing dark green screen  ...my old device even today working perfectly but the new device few issues otherwise mobile fine charging very fast and  no heating as many addressed
233,Mounika rakesh,Not a great phone. Average compared to other One plus devices,2.0,30,7,2021,1,3,"I was using One plus 5T for last 3++ years and enjoyed the phone performance but this Nord 2 5G is no where comparable to that phone. This Nord is quite heavy , audio quality is like a local phone, not a great camera etc etc . Overall not worth the 30k spent.Do not consider this as upgarde for existing one plus users. May be the first time one plus users might like it. Disappointing purchase."

236,Sathya Prakash Moparthi,Best in segment (if you don't want bloatware),5.0,22,1,2022,1,0,"If you are not a hardcore gamer and know what to expect from OnePlus brand, then this is the best in the segment.Coming to the Oxygen OS merge with Color OS, if you are not aware, even older devices like OP6 received the same updates (minus camera improvements) and it is much much better than the bloatware shoved in Mi/RealMe/IQOO devices.Camera is decent (all thanks to the decent sensor) but there is room for improvement in processing.You wont feel the battery to be inadequate thanks to the fast charger.Elephant in the room: Heating issue. Yes, if you use your device while charging or do hardcore gaming, heating is definitely noticeable (a lot).I have purchased this mobile for my mother and she is happy with the overall device, camera, screen brightness, charging speed, gaming capabilities. So If you are not a hardcore gamer, go for it."
237,Farhath Farhan,The best phone,5.0,15,1,2022,1,2,"What ever the news spread of blasts of phone is there with few units. But I'm using it from 3 months now, not a single issue. The best camera phone in this price range, even better than 9r I can say that. Cuz used both. All other stuff of phone usage is butter smooth.battery is little less...goes on a day but the charger is the best ever thing with this. Juices up in no time. Great job OnePlus Hope it remains the same as well. At this price range video quality is super cool and the day to day usage and ram management is top notch. Extraordinary performance with games as well. If the blast news isn't spread. Then this order would be the best smartphone of the year. But hope all becomes safe and secure.Hope so"
238,Manjunath,I got the product very earlier but the problem is heating issue,3.0,10,8,2021,1,1,I am very thankful to Amazon for fastest delivery but my mobile camera heats up a lot near rear camera and front camera only Using for only 5 minutes the temperature reaches upto 46 degrees celsius just using the camera for only 5 minutes . I made a complaint to Amazon on this issue but they did not solved my problem really I am so disappointed by this . I recommend those who are wish to buy this mobile don't ignore this problem . In this pandemic situation every single rupee has its own value
239,DSR,Very nice product 👍,5.0,19,9,2021,1,0,Nice looking mobile...u will feel premiumness when u hold the device....now pros1. Very good charging speed. Just plugin your device have a meal and mobile charged.2. Processor is of good quality....do all tasks in a very good speed...no hanging.3. Both cameras are of good quality... sometimes take very good shots ....... sometimes little bit missed shot.........needs some updates ..... specially front camera.......4. Speakers are good...loud volume.....good bakance of base and treble.5. Software is good...no bloatware.....but it should be pure oxygen OS... missing that feel little bit.6. Slider button is an add-on....Cons....1. Battery life while idle needs to improve.2. Cameras needs updates.....both are good at some point..but not consistent........ needs improvement specially front.3.RAM management can be improved.Now at last one plus please do something about  Nord 2 blast. Being OnePlus user i am scared of using my mobile. Atleast provide some clarity in this............
240,Chirag Narang,Good Phone Overall with Average Battery Backup,4.0,2,8,2021,1,1,I was initially looking for One Plus 9R but ended up buying One Plus Nord2 as both have similar features and costing of Nord2 is almost Rs. 10k cheaper.Pros-1. Good Processor2. 65W fast charging3. Fingerprint reader also very good4. Good SpeakerOverall functioning is quite good but I personally didn't like the battery backup. Its almost same as One Plus 6 which I was using earlier. Also it does not have Headphones jack
241,Rickson,"I've been using it for 4 months, here's what I think",5.0,3,2,2022,1,1,"Yes OnePlus has changed the OS, but it doesn't make a difference to you, let's start.1. You'll fall in love with the display and the battery charge speed.2. Initially there was a bad lag everytime I opened my phone, but apparently after I gave location permission to accessory settings, it was smooth as butter. (It might be because of the updates too)3.camera quality is okay. I had a RealmeX with me before, that took better photos.4. No overheating, i charge it near my bed, used to get scared initially, when the blast news was there, but eventually my attitude went to mehh5.Overall, good package as a phone. Basic functions are perfect. I'm a practicing doctor and this phone never has let me down when I needed it the most!"
242,sharath kumar vaidya,Don't buy any mobile on Amazon platform..,1.0,6,10,2021,1,2,"Don't buy any product on Amazon online shopping because they giving defective phone and I reported to customer services for my phone having heating issue, hidden problem & display brightness issue, cemara clarity etc...so they told me that we send to one technician person for resolve & diagnosis ur mobile phone, but no one came to my home for diagnos my mobile checking and again I complaint for this issue he said we have another process sir like u should download blancco mobile diagnosis app in Play Store, we try to solve ur problem through app, so I download it & he checked & diagnos everything and he said me ur phone having heating and some defective hidden problem what you noticed so we intiate replacement ! but I said that I don't want same mobile because if repeat the same problem how can I trust you? so I asked him can you please I want return only..he said that I convey message to my senior I'll let you, then I believe after that he put my called on hold and next second he cut my call. Again I called them no response from Amazon so complaint against Amazon & OnePlus in cybercrime at Hyderabad."
243,Om Prakash,Like It or Hate It,5.0,31,7,2021,1,0,"The new mid-range offering from OnePlus is here in the form of the Nord 2. This is OnePlus’ latest attempt to gain a firmer foothold in the market that it had more or less abandoned sometime ago in its conquest for dominance of the premium segment. This is the third iteration in the Nord series in India, and I believe it to be the most important one. OnePlus prides itself on offering a solid performance experience for the price and it is the foundation on which its empire has been slowly building.The OnePlus Nord 2 delivers on most aspects, and is priced as such to gain a wider audience in the highly lucrative mid-range segment. With its emphasis on camera performance, OnePlus has redefined its legacy while still packing in a punch with its processing capabilities.PROS✓Decent performance✓Excellent photography✓Software experience still the best✓Superfast 65W charging✓Dual 5G SIM support✓AMOLED screen (90Hz)✓Good battery life✓Fast charging✓Alert Slider✓Attractive, premium design✓Alert Slider✓Rear camera takes good low light pictures✓Selfie camera quality upgrade✓Good quality stereo speakers✓Great haptic feedbackCONS✕ Poor speakers✕ No storage expansion✕ No 3.5mm headphone jack✕ No IP rating for dust/water resistance✕ No wireless charging✕ No Reading Mode✕ Mono sensor not very useful✕ Screen brightness could be better✕ Low-light photography needs improvement✕ Inconsistent software design✕ GPU throttling✕ Peak brightness is lower than competition✕ Picture processing issues in HDR"

245,Sree,Not really good experience,3.0,11,8,2021,1,1,"I was using 5T and changed to this one (12GB/256GB).The major issue I face is on Android Auto.This is not getting connected on my Car, whereas the Connectivity on 5T is with ease.Another issue is the handset do not switch to Mobile data automatically, once the Wifi connectivity is not there. Have to disable wifi manually and then only mobile data gets connected.Really irritating"
246,Pankaj,Phone overheats with rapid battery drainage,2.0,22,1,2022,1,2,"After using One plus 6 for 3 years, decided to upgrade to Nord 2 5G. But am thorougly dissappointed of the product especially because of overheating and battery drainage. Reached out to customer care who had me format the phone twice. It worked ok for a few days but the problem came back. I am using the same apps and similar usage as my previous phone, so customer care's apprehension that apps running in the background are draining battery sounds ridiculous! Now they want me to wait for OS update to 12. Did not expect this from One Plus."
247,Ansh,Have some bugs!,2.0,27,8,2021,1,1,"After using for 1 month and 30 days:Phone is average because of its bug, if fixed, its a really a gr8 phone. Below are the major bugs m facing:1. A lot of times vdos don't play at all even if internet is fine.. it only start playing them after the phone is restarted..2. many a times keys in extreme right/left doesn't work.3. After typing in for google search when pressed search button, screen just comes back to home screen instead of search results."
248,Ranjan Ganguly,Very good for the price point.,4.0,30,12,2021,1,0,"The Nord 2 is the best budget phone from OnePlus in 2021 and it's safe to say it has delivered well. Especially effective a choice for students if you're looking for anything below 40k.The battery runs the advertised full day on medium use. Plus the comically fast charging takes mere 15 minutes to go from 10 to 100%. So even if you were to run out after intensive gaming, Netflix binging or whatnot, you can keep the phone charging during a snack break and come back to a full battery.The back camera is exceptionally good for the price point. As someone who uses the pro mode on the smartphone cameras frequently, it's safe to say it has numerous configurations. As a student the camera is also very helpful for two reasons. The main camera has a wide field of view, so it's easier to take pictures of my notebooks from a lower height and not strain my arms in the long run. Also the inbuilt Google lens option in the camera app helps get answers to most maths or physics problems you're stuck on in a jiffy.The front camera is a little lackluster in my opinion, with a little light leaking into it actually while the screen is kept at maximum brightness.The screen is good for the price point.  The lack of 120Hz refresh rate you see in YouTube reviews is not a problem if you're switching from a 60Hz screen. Rather the always on display options has been very helpful to keep my phone usage low.The Dimensity 1200 chip works fine for most of my school and social media uses. It works well for games too. Yet if you're a Snapdragon fan, you can pay a little extra and get the OP 9R.  Also, I have the little overkill 12GB RAM variant, so I have not faced any lagging issues in the first month of use, but the Dimensity chip with 8gb ram may become a bit slow with a year of use.I'm not particularly a fan of the gray Sierra colour, which is a bit muted for me. But I'm using the phone with an opaque case anyways so it doesn't bother me anymore."
249,Rajesh,App crashing,2.0,31,7,2021,1,2,"Hello everyone,I am facing this issues on Nord 2:1) Even though having free space of over 80GB+ but when I am updating a app on playstore it shows, me out of space and requires to free up space by deleting apps.2) Many apps are crashing, Flipkart, Google Maps, Camera, Telegram, Spotify, etc3) App Cloner not working (probably after using this only these storage issues started)Please Solve This Issues Quickly, OnePlus Team and thereby not regretting us our decision of buying this device at 30,000rs price point."
250,Sudhanshu S.,Not value for money.,3.0,6,10,2021,1,1,"Writing review after 2 months of use.PROS:- can show-off to very few people (for those who can't afford iPhone)- main camera is very nice- alert slider is very helpful- sound is awesome (phone speaker)- very good build quality- face unlock is pretty fast, like it's already unlocked- fingerprint works wellCONS:- portrait mode is not good if there are no human subject- battery lasts for 1 day- flashlight is less bright (compared to Lenovo p2a42, my previous phone)- works as wifi extender when I connectswith mobile data then switch to wifi (happens my macbook air 2017), othewise my mac keeps disconnecting 5-6 times before a stable connection.- sometimes caller id not appears- frozen notification for whatsapp call (while calling is going on)- sometimes notifications are not shown (for music)- sometimes notifications don't disappears in AOD screen- lacks in features compares to budget samsung phones- battery saver mode always on...even if you turned it off (my adguard keeps stopping in background, also asked in official forum, tried every possible way to keep it awake but it keeps stopping)"
251,Vishal Acharya,Honestly? You can get a better phone..,3.0,12,12,2021,1,1,"Alright, so since my first ever smartphone, I have always bought flagships. Be it iphones or Pixels. Been using this phone for 2 months now. This was my first 'Budget' phone.Honestly, I would say you can spend a bit more money and get an actual flagship or but OnePlus 9 or something. This I felt was not worth the price that I paid for it. There are more bugs on this phone than in my garden. Camera is Okay. I've seen better cameras, but then again, I'm used to flagships. Not many performance issues I'd say apart from the said bugs, like phone hanging or anything like that. Battery I wished would last a bit longer.An Okay purchase overall."
252,Anup Saud,Just go for it❤️,5.0,20,8,2021,1,2,"I felt like this oneplus Nord 2 is Best in oneplus nors series. It's worth of 30k. The 65w warp charger is just amazing that your phone gets charged from 0% to 100% in just 30mins. I did not not felt much heating issue. Frequently close the recent apps and clear the cache. If you strain the phone too much it will obviously heats. Camera is excellent . Display is just amazing. Phone runs pretty fast with Dimensity 1200 AI. If you are confused with 9, 9pro and 9R, would definitely recommend Nord 2 because it's worth the penny. 9 and 9pro doesn't make any sence with the hasselblad. Not much different with the cameras. It's seems just a hype. Go for Nord 2 you would save 10-20k comparing with the other 9 series."
253,Yogesh Pareek,A true value for money package... Flagship killer from OnePlus after long time,5.0,29,7,2021,1,2,Pros.A very handy phone with nice form factor. 90Hz amoled is buttery smooth.Camera performance is very good. Charging speed is killer hardly it takes 30 mins. For a full charge.Stereo speakers are also performing good.Network reception is also good no problem in low signal area.Cons.Battery is draining fast it hardly lasts for a day for a medium to heavy users. It drains near about 5-8% battery overnight without any usage. Which can be solved by ota update. Even i got one update recently.OnePlus should include a type c to 3.5mm jack dongle inside box.Overall a good package in 30k price bracket.
254,Hassan,Camera is not good,3.0,1,9,2021,1,1,"I bought this phone after watching the review that the camera is very good however it is not. When I clicked pictures from back camera from a distance the face of coming like it has been made with some app, it's not at all good. I checked with all the diff settings one could have done with camera to see if I am not using it correctly but sadly nothing worked. Then I asked for a refund which they denied and sent a mechanic at my place which said that it's OnePlus fault and will be corrected in the next update. Finally I got a replacement which is working somewhat fine then the previous. But still not fully satisfied.Other than that the battery life is good the charging is extremely fault, but if your buying it for its camera then it's a big NO"
255,Abhijeet,Display does not wake up sometimes.,1.0,28,8,2021,1,1,"Display does not wake up sometimes even if it is charged. Needs to restart the phone. While switching off, the phone flashes white screen. The phone delivered 5 days before writing this review. The issue already happened 3 times. There is no option to replace the phone now. Amazon only gave option to order Mobile Phone Inspection Service. The inspection will going to happen after 2 days. Will update the review after the inspection experience. Hope I will get replacement of th phone.When the mobile is working properly, it runs smoothly. Features are good. Camera is good. Worth the money if it doesn't give any trouble."
256,pallavi,Good phone with average camera,3.0,28,7,2021,1,4,"One plus Nord 2 is a good phone with average camera. Processor, display, touck response and fluid oled display is nice. Only disappointment is the camera. Hope they improve the experience with some updates."
257,BHUSHAN,Best mobile for simple usage,4.0,7,11,2021,1,0,"I've bought this on the first sale and I am using it ever since.Pros:1. Charging speed2. Ram management3. Camera in night mode4. Oxygen OSCons:1. Battery dischargeI am not a very heavy user, camera at night takes good shots for its price range. Battery charges very quickly but thr mobile lasts only half a day for non stop usage. But thanks to its 65 Watt charging, it charges very quickly, you can simply charge it while having lunch and you'll never notice the issue. Oxygen OS is so far so good. In hearing Nord 2 blast incident, I am a bit scared to use it, but so far I never experienced any heating issues. Sometimes it takes time to open file manager. On rare cases it may feel bit slow. With the frequent updates, those issues are going away. If you want a simple mobile which gives a premium feel, good camera and user experience go for it. Don't take this mobile with heavy gaming in mind. It can also easily tackle games but it's not thr best mobile for gaming."
258,Neel,A Good and practical phone,5.0,17,8,2021,1,2,"1. I haven't noticed any bugs. got an update when I booted the Phone for first time,maybe that fixed the bugs that people were talking about2. In hand feel is pretty good , both back and front are Gorilla glass 5 (I'd still recommend using a case)3. Camera : Rear camera is excellent in natural lighting and it is decent in artificial  lighting and as for the front camera : it's average front camera can definitely needs improvement (maybe future updates can do that)4. Performance wise it's pretty Good I didn't encounter any lag or frame drops whatsoever5. No heating issues ,I played BGMI for 2 hours and the highest temperature it reached was 39 which pretty normal and even while charging there was no heating6. Battery life is pretty good you can see my attached SS ,as I mentioned above I played BGMI for 2 hours and still got 6 hour's SOT ,for normal user's the battery will easily Last whole day and charging time is very low ,it Can go from 0-60 in around 20 minutes.My conclusion: considering the price point it's a very good phone and you should definitely consider it and if you're thinking of buying 9r then don't, Nord is a better choice then 9r.Hope this helps"
259,ASH,Poor Battery life and Heating,1.0,11,8,2021,1,0,"Hello friends,Whoever buying this phone after watching YouTube reviews that's it's agood phone should avoid this phone. there's is no return option eventhough your phone is getting heated or exploded.The only good thing I find its looks like a descent phone with good rear camera not super,smooth UI,alert slider.Apart from that it's a hyped phone,battery draining issue even in idle stage,background application run without opening,unexpected heating when kept in pocket.I strongly recommend Realme GT series /Vivo IQ phones over OnePlus phones.Don't think give it a try and it will explode for sure.Just check news on daily basis.I'm carrying a OnePlus bomb and no customer care gonna help me.Hope this information saves your money and life."
260,SHEIKH,Value for money!! nice purchase.,4.0,17,9,2021,1,0,"Its going to be a detail and honest one.i took a good 20-25 days to test it and wait for the update and then experience the update.Pros:1. Nice built and design with both side Gorilla protection. ** but be careful to protect the protection :D with back cover.2. display quality is top notch3. Rear camera is satisfactory4. Fast, furious RAM. 8gb is more than enough for a daily use with avg gaming unless you need more size to save files.cons BEFORE any update:1. Worst battery life. Drained so fast. Literally, water dropping from tank with big hole.2. Heating issues3. not very impressed with the front camera quality.Pros AFTER 2 updates[directed to last cons]:1. Battery management is improved significantly. i can use it for 24 hours in normal uses without lot of streaming and continuous use and thanks to their wrap charger BEAST. charges 0-100% in just 25-30 minthe good thing is the phone already have a built in battery management which is so smart and it prompts you kill unnecessary apps.2. Heating issue is slightly improved. i think these 2 are inter dependent.Cons AFTER 2 updates:1. slight heating issue. can be ignored.2. still not very impressed with the font camera quality."

I had sell both and some other things because these were not enough. Never regreted my decision. Such balanced sound  and highest picture quality that it can't be matches whatever you want to do -  play games, watching movies listen music- this phone runs smoothly  in every case. There is one problem though - my friend is sleeping without  chaarpaai and searching for me last 3 days :-("

267,sai s.,Some details you can know about,4.0,28,7,2021,1,2,"I was using a realme device,Now that OnePlus has merged colorOS and oxygenOS there is not a lot of difference I can see between both....But yeah oneplus has its core features reatined, there are a lot of changes made in settings which is similar to colorOS thoughOverall the phone feels snappier than everDisplay is pretty goodYou might not be happy with touch response while playing pubg/bgmiCharging speed is insane, and the battery lasts about a day with moderate usage ( including gaming )My personal experience ( tho I've used mine for 2 days) for now I'm getting about 5 hrs of screen on time with 1 hr of gaming- camera is not what I expected I am seriously impressed with the overall picture qualityAnd the night mode is not a gimmic it's for real goodIt could be that now because they are using oppo's camera it's doing a good jobGcam works great too-Overall would prefer this over poco or a realme device because my personal preference is a clean software please do some research before investing because end of the day it depends on which phone fullfils your needs"
268,Ranjan,Awesome mid range One plus phone,5.0,15,9,2021,1,1,"If you are searching for a mid range One plus phone with good camera and performance, then it's the ultimate buying option.Camera quality is too good. You can click very good photo's also perfomance is awesome, no lag or anything of that sort.Coming to the negatives, the battery drains faster but you don't have to worry any more, with the wrap 64W charger phone gets full charge within 30 mins.Since the OS is new, there are few niggles in the operation like, horizon light not working and a unknown warning kind of sound comes whenever there is new notification. Hope this will be fixed in the next update.Overall very good Product. If your budget is around 30k then this phone is ultimate option."

Missing headset and lack of expandable memory card are the missed out features. Its ok, with 12gb ram and 256gb of internal memory, memory management is quite suffice. Need to buy c type headset separately, it would be great if it is provided as a welcome goodie.😜"
270,shubham saraf,It's blast,1.0,1,8,2021,1,4,After seeing three blast incident of one plus Nord 2 . I am scare to use this phoneI want to return this phone. And one plus and Amazon should work together on this.All phones one Plus should recall and investigate why Nord 2 phone is blasting
271,Kevin,Deserves to be reviewed !!!,5.0,9,9,2021,1,2,"I generally do not review products on Amazon that I buy.. but I had to for this purchase..I research a lot before buying a new phone because I use it for long.OnePlus Nord 2 is an amazing phone. I don't know why people are giving bad reviews.  For me it deserves 5 star.1. Battery- I am a normal user. Battery easily lasts a day. Charging is super fast- 100% in 30 mins.2. Camera- I don't click many photos. But the one's that I have... have come out really good.3. Gaming- Runs smooth. No heating issue.4. User interface and experience- It looks premium and UI is also very smooth.5. Connectivity and browsing- excellentOverall- If you are looking for a great phone in 30k, then you must definitely go for it. For normal day to day activities I surely recommend this."
272,Abhishek shetty,Good phone and premium built quality,4.0,8,10,2021,1,1,"New phone initial review, only used for 5 days while submitting the review:Good phone with great built quality feels premium. (including phone cover, applied scratch guard, fast charger with cable)Good camera.Performance is also good as expected at this price.Fast charging is great, It takes around 35 to 40 minutes to full charge from 0% to 100%Nice display but could be better.Gets warm (not hot) while charging or sometimes using camera or playing games but it is normal and common with most of the phone also, because of glass back.Price is slightly higher."
273,Harshit,Best phone in 2021,5.0,10,9,2021,1,1,"I don't why the youtube community discourage this phone but it's now a month I have been using this phone and is the best ever device in 2021. Please don't hesitate, don't keep any second thoughts just go for it. One plus is one plus and not just ant brand out there and thanks to Amazon for providing me huge discount offer I got this product some what near 20ishhh. And I am delighted about it.."
274,Naredla Prasad,Awesome product,5.0,12,9,2021,1,2,"Features which I feel Worth buying are 1.camera 2.65watts warp charger 3.display 4.stereo speakers 5.allways on display loved it 6.touch response was awesome .A bit confusion while buying this device about its camera performance especially front one.but OnePlus has whipped up all my confusion with its camera features.it taking about 30mins for full charge from10% which giving me confidence even when my device is at low charge I could plan to go out with in 15 to 20min.no words to explain about its display quality , speakers and haptic feedback,Definitely feels like using flagship mobile.A major con is that its brightness is not sufficient when using it outside door midday.Overall it is a device with fully loaded features Worth buying at that price range.."
275,Gautam,Worst decision of my life,1.0,20,1,2022,1,1,"This is the first time i bought any phone, and within few days i felt like, why did i buy this. I tottaly regret to buy this phone. I mean i have used Oppo and Samsung my entire life. But the selfie camera of this phone is worse. I mean it feels like...as if we are clicking pics from a 2 Mega Pixel camera. And also my phone started showimg technical glitches from 2nd day itself. I was recording videos and they were not getting saved in the phone. i had to restart the phone again and again. I seriously dont recommend this phone. And i dont even understand why people are so crazy about One plus."
276,Rahul Sharma,Good in look and feel but doesn't deliver much in value.,3.0,30,7,2021,1,1,"128/8GB Blue Haze.I was using one plus 6 since may 2018 @33k 6GB/64GB bought it in first sale. And it was my first one plus phone, before this i used to love moto g series phones .Now wanted a change so bought this. My review is based on the experience comparing it to one plus 6.Build quality : Will give full marks 5/5 i liked it when i got the phone in my hand.Camera :Back-I am disappointed with camera. Op6 camera is far better than this the colors are very natural on op6 compare to this.Front: don't use much even on op6 so won't review, for me its okay on this device.Battery🔋: 4500 mAH comapare to 3300 , my 3 year old phone still runs for full day on full charge but this one little disappointed, attached the screenshot. In last 3 days this didn't go for full one day. My usages are mostly: whatsapp,slack, hotspot, mails, chrome etc. (NO  or very less music on loudspeaker, games I don't play at all.)Charging: just one word impressive.Display: Good not found much difference then op6.UI: definitely not good , don't like the navigation, caller app and recording alert to other user is very irritating, any time i open some app one or other t&c permissions very irritating and true isuues.Sound: much better than op6, stereo speaker is very nice.Overall good but when i look at my 3 year old phone which i bought at around the same price which in so many ways better than this, its little disappointing. I don't see this phone as upgrade to op6 except its 5G which i don't think is coming in India in very near future"
277,Dhwanit,Good phone with few misses,4.0,25,1,2022,1,0,"I am using this phone from past couple of days.1. Looks are good but doesn't really matter as it will always end up in a case2. Performance: Perfect for daily use. Switching between multiple apps is quick. I don't play games but I assume it will perform well there as well.3. Speakers quality is superb. I really liked the way it comes from all around the phone instead of just bottom.4. Camera quality is ok. Selfie could be better. I feel my OnePlus6 was better in camera. People used to ask me which camera you use. Now a days these companies are putting 30+ megapixels but result are still mediocre.5. One of the big miss is pocket mode. They should have retained it. Its an important feature.6. Also, there is no led indicator. You need to install 3rd party app to enable led indicator for notifications. Its just a software and oneplus should have offered it by default.7. Screen is very much readable in bright sunlight. So no issues there at all.8. I feel phone is bit hot when on long duration web calls.9. Transparent case turned yellow in few days. I assume its due to heat.10. shooting front and back video at the same time is a cool feature. I haven't used it yet but its interesting.11. Call quality is good.12. ear piece is loud and clear13. I miss headphone jack in these new phones. Buy a good quality type-c to headphone jack convertor.14. It comes with android 11. Should have come with 12.15. OnePlus promises to support the software update for three years. I hope it includes updating to latest OS not just security patch.16. Charging is super fast. 25% to 100% in less than 30 minutes.17. Battery life is average. Overnight - 10% discharge. General use continuously may last up to 5hrs. Or I can say can watch 2-3 movies.18. Overall dimensions are good."
278,Ayan Debnath,Best in price segment,5.0,5,8,2021,1,1,"The phone does not contain any flagship level thing for any part like processor or camera or display. But the overall combination of all makes it a complete package. Like the Camera is good enough but not extraordinary, Amazing night photography with the help of OIS and image processing, display is very good, Processor speed is very good, FP Sensor and Face unlock works fine. Most significantly, the OS, Oneplus never compromise it.Things that could be better:1. Image processing of both font and back camera could be better (Green is not so vibrant and does not give actual color after processing, RAW Image is fine) which can also be fixed with software updates. 8 mp ultrawide sensor could be better. Also macro option is missing. 2 mp sensor is worthless.2. Under display FP Sensor never works as fast as back or side mounted sensors.3. Battery performance is adequate for one full day 7-8 hour usage.4. Snapdragon 870 could be a better choice in this price.But this processor also does pretty well for day to day usage. ( I am not a gamer).5. Camera UI should not be changed like oppo."
279,Ritik,Front Camera Is Very Bad,3.0,28,7,2021,1,5,"Front camera is very bad  i mean very bad, i think they should fixed this issue by update rest all good"
280,SB,A perfect daily driver without busting the bank!,5.0,30,7,2021,1,0,"Well....the tagline says it all. EVERYTHING YOU COULD ASK FOR.Its a practical bunch of features with an amazing best in class camera. It outdoes a few flagships out there as well. The primary sensor in this phone is outstanding. Battery life is brilliant and will easily get you through the day even with heavy usage. The Amoled screen is good too and you won't really miss a 120hz refresh rate unless you're heavily into gaming. The integration with colourOS isn't really an issue unless you're an OxygenOS purist. I moved from stock Android and i would say I haven't been irked by any nuances of the Android skin. I really like how the adaptive brightness quickly learns if you don't like the screen too bright. Lastly, Mediatek has outdone itself with its Dimensity 1200 AI. You won't even realise that you have a ton in background apps running until you actually check.Would recommend anyone looking for a phone in this price point for a practical daily usage phone. For gamers, you'd be better for off with the Poco F3."
281,Amazon Customer,Overall good phone,4.0,29,7,2021,1,2,"Purchased on day of launch 26th July. Delivered next day.- Camera pics are good (back and front). It beautify pics, which looks very good but somehow missing originality.- Battery performance is good . 50-60% drained in normal use on day one (12 hrs). May be bit improve after optimization of some apps, notifications, etc.- Smooth operation of OS.- Wow factor is charging which is very quick. 40% to 100% charged in around 20 mins.- Rated one star less due to missing originality in pics and no wow factor except charging."
282,arushi,Front cam: Deal breaker,3.0,21,8,2021,1,1,"I saw really good reviews so i bought this one, taking good camera for granted. The front camera is anything in the low range phones(shocking), rear camera is good, video stabilization is given on both sides .Battery life is around 6-9 hrs on normal usage, fast charging is insanely good, takes you from 10 to 100 in less than 30 minutes.Might feel a little bulky, given the size.The back looks chic! but since it glass and its slippery, you're not going w/o the cover so no point.There are some nice features which arent necessary but cherry on the top."
283,Anandan,Nord 2 review after 28 days,4.0,23,8,2021,1,1,"Nord 2 review after 28days. Note that I was a Redmi Note 5 Pro user for the past 3.5 years.Pros- Excellent build quality. Feels definitely premium and top notch in hand feel. The protective case provided is good too.- Primary camera is great. OIS helps in better night photography as well. Front cam is ok- Battery life is admirable. Lasts a day, easily. 65W warp charge helps regain battery in no time.- Oxygen OS feels ok for me. No lags, no irrelevant apps or notifications. Maybe because I was annoyed with my previous MIUI which had annoying ads & notifications. But for existing OnePlus users who are planning to buy new OnePlus devices, the new ""Coloured"" change might not be pleasant.- Dimensity 1200 is too good for an above average user. No lags or frame drops. I'm not an avid gamer, though I was able to play BGMI in HDR & Ultra FPS settings @40+fps. Don't know if it's good fps for a phone at this price range.Cons- Display - The AMOLED display is okay for most part. But of you're an extensive outdoor user, then Nord 2 will be a disappointment for you. The screen could've been a little bit brighter under direct sunlight.- OTA updates - So far, I received 3 updates. But after the first update, the phone booted up with a Chinese message. Check out Geeky Ranit's review, many had the same issue. They could've made their Chinese identity less obvious.- Haptics - I now feel like the haptic feedback has been reduced after OTA updates, even though it's still good. I was just referring that they could do the same with every aspect of the phone over OTA updates.- No telephoto lens. Only gimmick monochrome sensor.Verdict: If you're a value for money guy + gamer, then Realme X7 Max is the right phone for you. On the other hand, if you need premium in hand feel + brand value + better camera and a clean UI then you can go with Nord 2. POCO F3 GT falls in between, I guess. If you don't need a flagship processor, then you can also refer Moto Edge 20 Fusion @21.5K, with stock Android, even though it's still Chinese. Indian users don't have many non-Chinese options to choose from. It all comes down to personal choice."
284,Manoj,A good all-rounder phone,4.0,16,8,2021,1,1,"Overall it's a Good phone with some minor problems. Display and Sound quality is great but I wish the display was a little brighter especially in outdoor conditions. Primary camera is great, wide angle lens is plain bad, 3rd camera is useless. The main problem I have with this phone is that it tends to get warm with minimal usage over period of time. Getting warm for gaming or camera is ok but warming for general usage is not. I hope OnePlus fix this.Otherwise it's a good phone for regular users, I haven't faced any lags or so in my usage. The UI is also very good. I don't care whether it's oxygen os or some other os as long as it runs smoothly (and without ads😉). This is far better than other crappy UIs out there. Battery life is decent not that great. For a heavy user like me, I have to charge it again in the Night. But charging is phenomenal. It just takes 35min to charge completely.If you want to buy an all-rounder phone for general usage with good primary camera, occasional gaming, good ui and better 5g support I recommend you to buy this. But if you want a gaming centric phone or an overall better all-round camera phone and Ok with bloatware and ad filled ui with very little 5g capability you can go with iqoo7"

However at this price, OnePlus could had done better."

301,PRASAD CHITRAPU,Overheating One Plus Nord 2.,3.0,20,11,2021,1,0,Everything is good. Being an ardent fan of One plus I bought but to my surprise the phone is getting heated if we use it continuously for 10-15 minutes. Intially I thought that it might be the issue with this piece. Again I requested for replacement of another one. Again the same issue of over heating. Even the customer care executive of One Plus also told that the issue couldn't be solved. That's I requested for refund. I request the One Plus mobile company to get thr issue resolved as early as possible to stand in the growing competitive mobile world.
302,Sandeep C M,Not up to the mark for 30k. Camera quality is poor for human subjects.,3.0,25,8,2021,1,2,"Material quality, display, speakers and charging are very good but disappointed on the camera. When clicking pictures of human subjects the face looks like painted. Also when images are zoomed there is very little details and no clarity.10k worth mi phone takes pictures with better sharpness and clarity. Adding to this camera application carshes intermittently and you have to restart the mobile to fix it."

   Starting with the camera for which I purchased this cellphone:Camera quality is good ok type If you really want to click decent quality pictures the. For the video section4k, the video is really good feels like a steady video and the quality is up to mark. You will get many features in the camera once you explore the camera.This is for you in your Budget of 30k.Now the performance in Games for Gamers:I'm not a hardcore gamer but my Usage for games is 2hr or 1hr a day continuous so that I don't feel any lag or overheating issue unless you're using for more than 4 to 5 hour's a day.Now comes the overall performance:As I see many of them said about bugs and all personally I really don't feel this cellphone has any bug if was there then it might be gone through a software update. Features given in this phone are really good for a mediator usage person this is really good.Built quality:Built quality is plastic with good screen display 90hrtz ambient display and charger is the most interesting thing I found you can charge full 0 to100 in Just 15 minutes that's super-fast battery life must be at least 5000 but that's ok for mediate user 4500.Overall good cellphone for 30k I had attached some pictures and one video hope you I'll enjoy it hit helpful if you really like my review.Keep rocking 🤟"

   Majority of us are just a normal users who want a good feature phone with good cameras , ui, connectivity and battery life.One plus Nord 2 basically does it all and even better, based on a normal usage , battery easily last for more than a day and even if it doesn't who cares , 0-100 in just 34 minutes. Camera shots are simply fabulous both in natural and low lighting , yea selfie is a bit dampner in comparison but not that bad either. Above all what matters the most the the clean UI, yes it's collabrated with ColorOS, but if you are really a normal one plus user , you will heardly find any difference, it's smooth, fluid and great to hold. Display could have been a bit brighter but again nothing to complain. One of the early buyers of this, and got a great exchange rate for one plus 5, so basically for 21k, this was just perfect.  I still feel the 6gb is the more justifying the price point. So may you can try out your luck from the 31sr August."
305,pankaj,CAMERA REVIEW,2.0,29,7,2021,1,2,Recently bought an OnePlus Nord 2 5g. I am really impressed by the photo quality of the phone but the video quality is not good at all. The videos taken from this phone seem oversharpened. If you are taking this phone for video recording than I would suggest you better not invest in this device. The Colour OS is messing up the camera algorithm. Earlier the video quality of OnePlus was absolutely fantastic but now it has gotten worst with OnePlus Nord2.
306,Shivaan Tomar,OnePlus phones are iPhone's of the Android World,5.0,7,9,2021,1,1,Would come straight to the point about Nord2 (8Gb Ram Variant)Pros -1) Sturdy Design2) Fast WiFi connectivity3) Surround sound and loud speakers4) Camera is good for amateur photography5) Toggle switch for Ring/Vibrate/Silent modes is a good features on this phone6) MediaTek 1200AI is fast7) Battery Life is good. Heavy users can expect a full day usage easily.8) Charging is really fast. 65W charger charges the phone from 15 to 100 within 40 mins.Cons1) No 3.5 Mm jack2) 410 PPi feels pixelated sometimes if you look very closely but colors are very natural3) No 4k at 60fps but a concern for Content creators only not for average users.Would suggest you guys to download Nova Launcher as I personally feel it really brings the best out of this phone in comparison to Oxygen UI.
307,Amazon Customer,Value for money,5.0,24,12,2021,1,0,I am happy customer of OnePlus Nord 2. I am first time user of OnePlus. It is good as per my expectations.Pro's -1. Camera quality is good.2. Battery lifer is excellent.. easily you can use 100% charged phone for 1.5 day.3. Warp charger is excellent (dual cell battery).. 100% charged in 30 minutes. Which is really good.4. Processor is meadiatek 1200. I was looking for snapdragon. But this processor is really good.5. Display is good.6. Finger print is okay.Cons.It does not have expandable memory card option.No 3.5mm headphone jack.
308,TheCherryOnCake,Pretty much Flagship phone,4.0,11,9,2021,1,1,"Beautiful colour GREENWOODSBattery backup n charging is superb ,Camera is good but not as satisfactory as their oneplus 7 PRO, my earlier phoneDisplay n resolution does seem like a cheap phone for those who used 7 pro/ series.Lighter in compared to other 256gb storage n 400mah variants of oneplusYet to check on heating issues but noticed out of 2 sims, only one has VoWifi option"
309,NSG,Value for Money,4.0,11,11,2021,1,0,I've been using it for almost 2 months. And I could say this really a value for money from OnePlus. I feel battery backup could be improved. Daylight camera is good but low-light camera is really surprising. Sometimes it heats up even though it's not being used heavily and sometimes the temperature is very normal even though I'm playing game for long time. Sound quality is very good. I found the only major issue is heating issue. Dimensity 1200 is giving a lag free experience and for that mediatek should be appreciated. I'm only concern about future ColorOS update. It's a request to OnePlus to keep the OxygenOS as much as OxygenOS.
310,LEGAL W.,Bad operating system and fear of blast,1.0,15,9,2021,1,1,I have purchase it before 7 day and very disappointed by operating system if oneplus have already best os then why merge colour os very bad experience with operating system most features are not available and recently blast fear keep me away from my phone dear oneplus if you can't focus on customer need oneplus brand condition will be same as NokiaMain cons1 Not full oxygen OS2 auto call recording not possible3 battery drain too fast4 fromt camera quality bad than 12000 phones5 phone blast fearPron1 looking pretty2 charging very fast3 display qualityPlease oneplus consider customer need otherwise you will be same as Nokia
311,GVR SHARMA,Blue Haze color loved it.,4.0,8,8,2021,1,0,"Using the mobile since one week , this is my first one plus mobile.Pro'sDesign.............9Blue Haze color u definitely love it.Software & performance.....9Camera quality.......8.5Battery life......7.5But 65W warp charge, full charge in 15 to 20 mins thats save ur time.No need to buy mobile cover its in box.Good Fingerprint reader.Con'sBattery drains little fast would have given more MHz.No extended memory card , no 3.5mm jack need additional gadget for usage.No IP rating.competition has 120hz refresh rate display."
312,Mohamed Bilal,Software optimisation is very poor,2.0,18,9,2021,1,1,"Here are my main issues with this phone:1. Battery: even though it only has 90hz display compared to 120hz on other similar priced phones, the battery on this phone not very good. Especially the idle battery drain is very bad. Overnight I lose around 10% of charge everyday.2. Heating: The phone heats up lot especially during charging and camera use. This along with cases of this phone blasting is very concerning.3. Performance: There are no major lag issues, but there are some annnoying stutters here and there.4. Camera: camera was one of the reasons I baught this phone. Every reviewer was saying camera is excellent and best in segment for this phone. I would say the photos are okay, but in some cases auto hdr makes things look too saturated and unrealistic. Coming to video, 1080 60fps looks like 240p the clarity is trash, there are some annoying stutters in 4k 30fps and 4k 60fps is not even available. So expect get good video in 1080p 30fps only... Even then its nothing outstanding.Overall oneplus needs to work on their software as this phone has decent hardware. Also they need to resolve blast issue asap or call back these phones.This is as of 18th Sep 2021"
313,Adiroopa Mukherjee,Good phone at the price,5.0,23,11,2021,1,0,"I was torn between shelling out more money for a One Plus 9, but I am so glad I bought the Nord 2 instead. What a great phone! I've been using it for a week so far, but my usage is pretty heavy as I work with digital and social media full time so I'm ALWAYS on my phone. This works like butter - response speed is good and the camera is pretty great (especially the night mode omg).  After I ordered my phone I read and re read all the reviews on here and began to panic about the battery overheating and incompatiblity comments but luckily I have faced none of those issues so far.I am 100% happy with this purchase so far, and glad I saved the extra money. Hones anyway have a short shelf-life nowadays so rather than shelling out a bomb for a device that you will change in a year or two, go for a cheaper alternative like Nord 2 without second thought. And frankly Nord 2 may be cheaper but it gives One Plus 9 a good run for its money... One Plus living up to its flagship killer reputation once again 😎"
314,Ankuchat,Best for the Price,5.0,24,9,2021,1,1,"I am a loyal OnePlus User I have used OnePlus X, 3 and 5 before this Nord 2.Compared it thoroughly with OnePlus 9 but this phone wins every damn time!Good CameraGood BatteryAppropriate size smaller and lighter than 6-7-8-9 and 9Pro.Worth the price and the blue looks really nice.Comes with a screen gaurd and a transparent phone cover added with charger and USB cable."
315,Barani Ram,A Decent Buy,4.0,19,9,2021,1,1,Very good budget phone... After 1 month of usage I am writing this...Pros1. Good Display2. Insane fast face recognition3. Nice finger print sensor4. I was worried about Mediatek Dimensity...But its been performing more than my expectations5. Decent back cameras6. I see many negative reviews about battery performance but I found ok ( not great )7. Insane warp chargeCons1. Software tweaks required on some areas...Like if there are unread messages in inbox u can't view the new messages from the same sender when phone is locked ( Headache when dealing with OTP )2. Very Bad display when used in a bright daylight.. you may not see anything3. Sometimes battery draining is little higher while watching continuously ( I am Compensating by Auto switch on switch off at night )4. A Concern on battery life on the long run....VerdictA smooth fast Oxygen OS with capable hardware makes this one a good buy...If battery gets updated to 5000 mah or more nothing can challenge One plus phones...
316,Ramki Ranga,Camera and battery heat issues,2.0,20,8,2021,1,0,Observations in two days of use:1. Camera doens't support zoom for 50mp and there is no flashlight for portrait mode picture.2. Found hearing issues when charged on given one plus box charger but the phone doesn't heat with other branded fast chargers.3. incoming caller id is not full screen supported.4. Speakers is ok quality only. Hungs when you insert an external device  (pen drive)  which has only 100 mb on the device. overall just an average phone.5. Also not able to recognise face in low lights which is another drawback for facial recognition.
317,Kashif,Awesome Hardware but Buggy Software,4.0,31,7,2021,1,1,"Hardware (display, speaker, cameras, vibration, charging) is awesome.Software- Smooth UI but unpredictable, app closes even without giving any error- Parallel app not working after update- Update happens automatically (it should ask if we want to update or not)- Google Play Service power drain- OS not fine tuned."
318,sundhar,Worst product from OnePlus,3.0,31,7,2021,1,3,You can buy better mobile with this budget. Camera doesn't feel like OnePlus - Poor quality (Front camera is the worst ever for a mobile with this budget). Only good thing is processor so Mobile doesn't lag or hangs up. Not worth for the price. Worst ever product from OnePlus. Speaker quality is worse.
319,Anand,Good in the price range,4.0,12,9,2021,1,1,"Hi, I am an avid OnePlus user since the day I put my hands on OnePlus 3. I have used it gifted almost every future version of it.I upgraded myself from 5T to Nord2 and i must say it is a fresh feeling. Camera is nice and storage is great. However it lacks a premium feel. You ll feel the it is a step child of oneplus and definitely not a fine piece of work."
320,Raj M.,A very good all-rounder.,5.0,4,10,2021,1,1,"Although this phone doesn't excel at any particular field, except the software, which is the best at this price point; it does everything very well without missing on anything major. Great display, great camera, great performance, great battery, great charging speed, great build, great software, good speakers and great ergonomics. If you want a phone to do a very particular thing very well, this phone is not for you. But if you want to do everything well, without any major drawbacks, go for it."
321,Manish Daryani,Okayish phone - not worth the hype,4.0,5,8,2021,1,1,"I got my phone a few days back. To be honest, it seems overhyped. The features are ordinary, at best.However, camera quality is really awesome. The clarity of the photos is super amazing.The battery drains quite fast and there are heating issues.Also, the speaker sound quality is not so good. I saw a few comments which mentioned speaker quality is awesome. Wonder if it's the case with my phone only then.The screen seems a bit narrower. Although, it makes up for the same in length."
322,Rahul M.,"The caller id is flawed, and many user unfriendly features",2.0,6,9,2021,1,1,"The caller name and the green icon to accept the call doesnt show up till atleast 3 rings. Even the contact app's fields do not show up intuitively when you are typing into the field if it is lower down the screen. Various app screens become much darker on their own, even though the brightness on all the other apps at the same time is as per the phone setting. Call history doesnt show multiple calls to the same number in the day, it only shows the last call. The list is much longer, this is just the introduction to all the problems with this phone. I have been a loyal OnePlus user from the time it's 1st phone was release, this time I am sorely sorely dissappointed with Oneplus."
323,Akshay,"Worst phone by Oneplus, Period.",1.0,12,1,2022,1,1,"After using Oneplus 3 for 5 years I was never in doubt about my next smartphone company.But after using this piece of s**t for almost 6 months, I really regret my decision.For the starters, software is crooked. Pure OOS is not there, there is weakest software support for dimensity chipset. You cant sideload apps and even Oneplus Phone and  msging app is also not available for Nord 2. Gaming app is provided by some other company. Phone is not listed in oneplus' own website in software support download and update section. They also just dont want this shameful thing on their website.And they dont want to support this phone at all.Camera is the worst thing in this camera, dynamic range is non existent on all the cameras.selfies are laughable and Ultrawide camera details are a joke.Only one thing is there which is good, charging speed. Its fast. But if you are heavy user, that 4500Mah will last only for a day."
324,Jawaria,I'd rather go back to my old phone.,3.0,31,8,2021,1,1,"The phone is just average. After a month of usage, I can say the following things:1. Slow finger print reader. I compared the fingerprint with a friend's 9R and it's way faster.2. Okay Battery Life. Even though it comes with a 4500 mAh battery, it drains rapidly even on just playing music.3. Lagging. On apps like Facebook and Instagram, the comments won't show at once or reels might get stuck. On calls: When I try to cut the call, it will not end.4. Touch sensitivity. Even when you're not touching anywhere, I don't know I click at places I don't want to.5. Camera and OS. Only the camera is the best feature and that it comes with Android 11.I was previously using a Samsung phone until I broke the screen so I decided to buy OnePlus.But I would rather go back to using my old phone.Don't spend your money if you don't have a lot. Go for a cheaper phone or a higher range phone or find something else in this same mid-range.Just average."
325,Suryendu Das,Even replacement phone stopped working after 2 months,1.0,25,10,2021,1,1,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Worst quality. The first phone hanged within 7 days. So it was replaced. The second phone has stopped working after 2 months. Extremely disappointed. Now have to run behind service centres. Will keep posted on that.Continued: Customer care repaired the phone. But the problem is back within a week. The phone hangs and shuts down if you watch youtube. 4th class quality. Watch the video.🙏🙏🙏"
326,Thomson C.,A lagfree super quick handy phone but lags a big time on camera.,2.0,19,12,2021,1,1,"Only 2 drawbacks that made me rate the phone 2 out of 5 are 1st i bought the phone based on its camera quality and latest imx processor in it. But to be honest it didn't do any justice. A phone thats in a range of 30k should have atleast made the camera far more better.Leave zooming of pics, which I dont want to talk about, a normal pic looks like a water colour painting. ESP when you are taking pics of ppl in bright day light.2nd I would say that finger print sensor is not that quick. There is some lag while compared to others.. but not that bad. Hardly few more micro seconds more. But it counts.-Final verdict: if you are looking for a phone with descent camera never go for it pls. Else for rest of the features I would rate it 8.5 or 9 out of 10."
327,Ramanuj,Not recommended,1.0,20,1,2022,1,1,"I purchased this phone soon after the launch in India. After using 4-5 months, here is my review.First, the default calling app is not working properly for last couple of months. During incoming call phone rings, but calling notification does not come. It is not showing the caller name or number. So, you cannot receive the call, but surprisingly phone rings. For outgoing calls after dialing the number, phone does not show the name whom I am calling. But, the call connects in background. To overcome this, I changed the default calling app to Truecaller, but I faced a different issue there. Trucaller fails to update the calls. It shows the incoming or outgoing calls up to last day.Secondly the battery back up is very very poor. I use the phone for calling, messaging, emailing etc, means for moderate use. I never play games and rarely watch video or YouTube. But, it is giving 10-12 hr back up after full charge that too by using power saver mode after 15% backup.OnePlus is know for its outstanding camera. I will rate the camera is above average but not excellent.Another drawback is heating issue. Sometimes it heated up so badly, it remember me the incidents of blasts. Now I think that incidents are not rumors, it's true.Another hype is that one plus community. You will find some preinstalled OnePlus apps on your phone. You will think oh! they care for us. You have purchased something premium. OnePlus actually care for their purchaser. This is another myth. If you raise any issue on OnePlus community they will guide you to visit customer care and they will only bother you to find your nearest customer care. There are many companies who actually resolve different software issues over chat. But, you should not expect anything like that from OnePlus.Actually, I only like the fast charger and Oxygen OS. The OS has something exciting, you can hide your apps. Zen Mode is there which restricts over usages of phone. The fingerprint bio-metric is works very well. Facelock also detects face perfectly.Overall, at this range  where you will get many options, I will not recommend this OnePlus Nord 2. Due to aggressive pricing they compromised with quality."
328,MW,Feels quite premium,5.0,7,8,2021,1,1,"Performance: 10/10 (no lags or stutters)Software: 10/10 (Didn't feel buggy at all; very smooth experience post updates - I am a first time OnePlus user)Battery: 7.5/10 (Drains a bit fast, 7 hrs of screen on time with no heating issues. I am not an avid mobile gamer)Camera: 9/10 (Primary camera is simply amazing)Sensors: 10/10Call quality: 9/10Features: 10/10 (lots of useful features)Design and sturdiness: 9/10 (great design, but feels very slippery in hand)These are my initial impressions. Will update after prolonged usage.Update 1: Post the news of blast, I wanted to return this device considering personal safety. However Amazon refused the request. This is bad on Amazon's part because this device may be hazardous for personal use and they should make an exception in their refund policy in case their customer's personal safety is in question. Didn't expect this from Amazon."
329,dwaraka,Sensor is not working,3.0,28,7,2021,1,1,Started using since yesterday. Did not see any issues . Battery lasted for one and half day with moderate usage. Day light camera is very good. Very light weight. I don't see any lag in performance as I don't play much. One issue I found after using for one week is home screen is not changing automatically though I choose auto update everyday. Sensor is not working
330,Prathyu G,Oxygen os fans will be disappointed. Otherwise it's best in class,4.0,15,8,2021,1,0,"I'm writing this review after a two weeks of usage. I'm changed to this phone from my OnePlus 6, after a 3 years of usage and it's still young and works smoothly. From that point of view everything is better and upto the mark expect the os. As a fan of oxygen os the things are changed a lot in so many areas. I only stuck with the OnePlus is because of the Oxygen os and it's personalized features. This changes make me very bad and have to consider other brands in my next upgrade. In camera app, settings and so many areas they made a mix of colour os. Also dialer and message apps are run in orginal stock android experience and no oxygen os customisation In hardware and other performance area it's worth buying and no issues with that. I'm not a gamer so can't say anything about this areas.Also seeing lot of reviews from other people and my experience this is the best phone by OnePlus in 2021."
331,Arya Nandan,Overall performance of the phone is good. Camera quality is good.,3.0,12,9,2021,1,3,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Fingerprint reader and face detector are excellent and touch sensitivity is great. Battery performance has reduced after 3-4 months use. But fast charging charge is a great help. There is a slight lag sometimes when the battery percentage is below 20%"
332,Praveen,Not too good nor not bad,5.0,18,8,2021,1,0,"Everything is ok,but my expectations are;1)While using in sunlight display need above 60% brightness for clear visible.2)I think they can give 5000mah battery in this model.3) Floating window option is not there for all apps.4) For grey color model I cant feel back side corilla glass is there,but officially they are saying some other technology is made.5)Some other unwanted apps are there:I cant made it as disable and even I cant uninstall it.6)I except OnePlus dial pad but it's now changed."
333,Ramakrishna,Not worth of the price,3.0,11,9,2021,1,1,"The phone is okay but not great when u conoqre it with price vs value / performance.1. Battery drains faster at times and it doesn't last more than 12 hrs.2. Camera stopped in between and it hangs while shooting a video and didnt respond. I had to restart the phone allover again tonuse the can. Not expected at all.3. Volume and power keys are completely gone wrong. Such a bad placement. For every press of power key other side of your hand will touch the volume key, the placement of keys and ergonomics are completely inappropriate. It's almost 2-3 weeks still I need to be very careful.4. Plastic bakc/ body won't let you remove the cover anytime. You have to protect like a baby at this price this plastic back is not worth.These are most problematic things, other postives people have already told but the big issues are as above."
334,deepak sharma,Genuine review after 7 days,1.0,11,8,2021,1,2,"After 7 days usage genuine feedbackVery fast battery drain like 2 years old phn,Auto call recorder not availableNot at all satisfied with phn under 30KNeed refund"
335,Pandu,Awesome Look and Feel,4.0,30,7,2021,1,0,First of all I would like to thank Amazon for the quick delivery.. when it comes to the mobile ..it's just awesome.... Looks like very premium phone... And i will give my honest review here...Pros:1) Display is awesome2) Refresh Rate : Woww3) Quick Charge: OutstandingCons:1) Battery is draining: I had little very less still it had darined out in 12 hours.2)  No 3.5 Audio jack3) Cloning apps is an issue at this moment might wipeout with software update.
336,Tejas4u,Good quality premium phone,4.0,7,9,2021,1,1,"In screen Finger print reader is not good. You have to wake up the phone and then use the fingerprint reader. I guess the whole technology of in screen Finger print reader in all the brand's is not good.Battery life is super awesome, once my Nord 2 went on for 2 fulls days on a single charge. The 65 watt warp charger is wow, it changers your phone upto 90 % in just 20-25 mins.Camera is too good, I like it. I have personally found the images to be sharp and crisp. The front cam is decent too. I like the clear images from wide angle and depth sensor cam as well.In all very good camera and superb images on Nord 2 both front and back.To conclude, I would say, apart from the in screen Finger print reader being slow, Nord 2 is a really premium phone, it gives you that plush one plus premium feel and one should go for it.I got the green wood colour and plz note that green wood colour has a leather like finish at the back and the back is fiber based and not glass back.The other two color options of Blue Haze and Grey Sierra comes with Gorilla glass back."
337,Gopesh Khandelwal,27K to flaunt the one plus logo,3.0,1,1,2022,1,1,"Compared with some other phones in this segment only.Go for it if you want to give out a statement that You could buy an iPhone but you didn't because you don't like iOS.CAMERA: Back camera does a decent job, night mode is good. Front camera is very very poor, you'll have to unlearn taking selfies.Fingerprint sensor: In-display, works 3 out of 5 times. The sensor doesn't get activated sometimes when you raise your phone.Battery: Gives you 5-6 hours of continuous usage.Charging: Amazing charging speed. very fast.Speed/Lags: You don't expect a 30k phone to lag/freeze but it does that sometimes while taking calls. Sometimes the light sensor doesn't really work.Display: Fairly goodSound: Audio is not balanced with front-firing speakers. At full volume, it sounds like an old Chinese phone."
338,Sahil gyanchandani,One of the best if not the best.,5.0,23,8,2021,1,0,"I chose Nord 2 as a upgrade over OnePlus 6t and im very happy with my desicion.Let's talk about pros and cons of this device.Pros:Rear Camera 9/10Display 8/10Battery 8/10Charging speed 10/10In hand feel 10/10Speaker loudness 10/10Call quality 10/10Ad free and bloatware free experience 10/10Cons:Ultra wide angle Camera 6/10.Audio via type C jack 5/10.Since OnePlus is using a mediatek processor along with color os beneath oxygen os, this smartphone has huge scope of improvement, especially with performance and camera as they have much more potential. With regards to updates, OnePlus sent 3 updates within 15 days of launch. Things improved to much extent by those updates, hope they keep sending these kind of updates."
339,Mohsin Ahmed,OnePlus Nord 2 5g Review,4.0,28,7,2021,1,3,"My reviews after using the mobile 2 days.No doubt, Nord 2 came with great look 5/5, mind blowing audio quality 5/5, Display 4/5, battery backup 4/5, battery charging (65w) 5/5, Performance 5/5, worth of money.."
340,Shreya,NO CALL RECORDING SYSTEM,1.0,10,8,2021,1,1,"The phone is overall very good . The camera is upto the mark , speed display battery everything is a good package . But this phone does not have an default app for calling , the google dialer is there which will give you and the other caller an awful notification while you record . The phone is worth 35k but the call recorder lacks it is a dummy for the people needs that feature . The third party apps also not works , one plus apk does not get installed . People who are looking to buy this please consider this issue before buying and i say that go for other mobile with less anroid version to avoid this problem ."
341,Prince,Overall experience,3.0,3,9,2021,1,1,"There is nothing amazing about this phone, i felt i will feel different after switching to OnePlus, but i am dissappointed. I am not sure about other one plus set. Phone gets heat up on playing games and even batter backup is not great, does not hold long. Battery does get charged up at lightining fast. Camera quality isnt that great. No audio port so you have to be completely dependent of wireless headphones. So this aint a best handset at this price range though it has launched this phone at a cost effective price range. I bought this phone the day it has launched and later i realised i should have done thorough analysis and comparison. There is nothing wrong about the phone, it is just that when you expect more and you dont get it. I meant experience. Screen resolution i didnt find it great even."
342,Mohsin,It's not that bad mobile for normal usage.,4.0,9,11,2021,1,0,"Improvement required for below scenarios -1. Battery life should have improved which is not worth for this price.(Actual battery - 4500mah, expectation - 5000mah plus)2. Camera quality is not that good specially front camera.3. Design should be different it looks similar to previous OnePlus Nord.4. No IP rating which is too bad for this price.Other than these above disadvantages mobile is good for normal usage and you can go for it.If camera is your main expection then please do not buy this mobile. Daylight photos are normal but shots from the ultra wide angle camera aren't good at all."
343,BRC,Not worth buying,1.0,17,12,2021,1,0,"I have been using OnePlus mobiles since 2014 and have very good experience of OnePlus mobiles. But, this oneplus Nord2 has completely destroyed my faith not only in this mobile, but also in the company's service. This mobile does not allow you to upgrade patches, softwares. You have to take it to the service center. The oneplus service centre people are also very unprofessional. They will waste your time.Overall, oneplus has also opted the path of Nokia and it will achieve the same fate."
344,Nirmal,The phone is lagging after a month,3.0,29,7,2021,1,0,I'm got it for 29.5k. And using this phone for past 3 days. Here is what I felt about this phone while using.ProsBuild of the phone is greatSound is crisp and clearOptimization of OS good have not found any lags so farBattery performance is top-notch and charging too.ConsLag of many appsCamera performance is ok .. not at par in comparison with the competition like realme x7 pro. Not saying its useless but not greatDisplay feel a bit dull in direct sunlightHaving a bit heating issues while using continuesly4g support is laging at time. Feel faster at time and very slow at time. Maybe a network issue not sure.Overall it's a decent phone. This phone is for those whose preferences are1. Great build2. OnePlus brand3. Oxygen OS4. Camera is not priority5. Great battery performance and charging
345,Satheeshkumar Selvaraj,Everything is great except for the heating issue.,3.0,5,9,2021,1,1,"The phone has great features like best camera quality, smooth to use, speed, etc. But all these good features are overridden by one negative aspect which is the heating issue. The phone gets heated up so quickly, especially when you play games or use AI mode while taking photos it gets heated up in just couple of mins. I purchased this phone despite reading the news about couple of one plus Nord blast incidents thinking that could be due to other factors as explained by the company in the news, but now I regret my choice."
346,Ritesh K.,Review after 2 months usage!,1.0,10,10,2021,1,1,"The product isn't the flagship killer phones OnePlus used to sell, I don't know if the OnePlus 9 still has that oneplus spark in it but this one is a disappointment. The phone keeps lagging with the apps, literally every minute now. I had a OnePlus 5t before and I can promise, that phone worked better after 3.5 yrs of usage than this one after 2 months. The battery gets up in 25 mins but that's no use cause it gets down by 10, max 12 hours. The camera is the worst thing stuck on this device, wouldn't stop lagging for a minute and is totally worthless like the oppo cameras(which is used on this one). The only thing I liked about OnePlus phones is the oxygen os which is still there in this one but it seems a lot buggy. I am just hoping that the updates solve them all. Yet if I were to recommend it to an enemy, nah I won't."
347,Vimal agarwal,Best phone,5.0,4,11,2021,1,1,एकदम अच्छा मोबाइल है मैं इसको 1 महीने से यूज कर रहा हूं बहुत ही यूजर फ्रेंडली है और इसका बैटरी में कोई प्रॉब्लम नहीं है कुछ लोगों के रिव्यु पड़े थे मैंने कि इसकी बैटरी जल्दी गर्म हो जाती है तो ऐसा कुछ भी नहीं है बहुत ही अच्छा मोबाइल है यूजर फ्रेंडली है इसके अलावा सारे फंक्शन बहुत ही सॉफ्ट तरीके से काम करते आज तक का मेरा सबसे अच्छा अनुभव है मेरे पास आईफोन भी है पर उससे भी अच्छा है कोई इसके बारे में गलत बोलता है तो उसको कुछ नॉलेज नहीं है या उसको मोबाइल चलाना नहीं आता फाइव स्टार में इसको दूंगा
348,Niteesh Reddy,Worst product from One Plus,1.0,2,12,2021,1,0,"I have never expected such a pathetic product from one Plus. This is my second one Plus device & I have been using this since 2 months.=> From the look wise the phone is looking very good=> Sound is very pathetic. I can hear the sounds like in old cheap chinese mobiles. Very loud & not clear at all with buzz sound.=> Though the pictures are appearing good, they look worst when zoomed (especially people's faces). Photos on One Plus 7 are pretty good when compared to the photos captured on this device.=> My device has 12GB RAM. Though the performance is good, the phone stucks sometimes.=> Battery backup is good (More than a day with medium to less usage).=> Screen protector provided along with the phone is of worst quality. Bubbles started appearing within just 2 months usage."
349,Dr ashish,Worst phone. One plus making fool in the name of flagship brand.,1.0,14,9,2021,1,1,".Plz plz plz don't buy this phone. After using 1 month this phone . I only say one plus making fool . Before I use one plus 5 . Now using this phone. I never feel I am using one plus . I just feel I am using oppo. Or vivo phone. Google dailaer is very slow. Very slow refresh rate. Poor battery backup  Poor screen on off . There is hang problem. Phone excessive heat, One plus worst phone is this . If one plus giving same software of oppo vivo phone. Then why we buy 30000 rs. We just buy oppo vivo phone in 15-20 k . For the same function n quality.. the bad part of this very very slow. Phone. And very poor refresh rate"
350,R Mariadass,Don't see Other negative reviews .. It a decent flagship phone,5.0,13,11,2021,1,1,"Actually I was using before samsung m30s , so after using 6gb ram 128 rom smartphone when you jump to OnePlus Nord 2 ..you will find that ..Wow this mobile is so cool ..I find myself as cool ..okay ..that's good ..but if you are using allready a flagship killer mobile ..this should not be your choice actually .. personaly I like this phone ..it has 90 hz refresh rate ..but it has 60 hz refresh on YouTube ..gaming supports 30 fps ..no lagging ..no heating ..will heat when you play for longer time ..speakers are really amazing ..to hear ..very loud loved it ..smooth as butter ...and I'm using 12 GB ram 256 rom .. varient"
351,shabbir,Phone gets hanged and restarts suddenly.,1.0,18,9,2021,1,1,"Since the very 1st week of the purchase of the phone I'm experiencing trouble with this phone, the phone suddenly restarts. Initially it used to happen once a day atleast in frount of me whilst I was using it, It might be restarting on its own even when the phone used to be idle. Now the phone restarts atleast 3-4 times a day. Completely un accepted performance from Nord2.I complained this to the customer care, they merely took note of it but I never got a call back from them, needless to mention, pathetic after sales service as well!!I want a new device or I'll see yaal in the Court of law!"
352,Mokshdhar Meshram,"Camera is not good, Battery drain to fast, max. App permission is unnecessary",4.0,4,8,2021,1,1,"1. Best fast charging , about 30 to 35 minut  to full charg 0 to 1002. Amoled display with 90 hz is best optimiz with O.S.3. Camera is one of the best.4. Without phone call, storage , photo, call , contact, location etc. Permission Maximum app not open it is not good5. Phone battery is discharged fast its also not good6. Mobile data consumption is very high I don't know why..??7. Custom settings is limited8. 3.5 mm jack is missing9. Clone app not worked properly10. Need to some updates.....This is my 3 day experience with oneplus Nord 2, a little disappointed with this phone"
353,Shubhangi Sharma,Finish Issues my phone,4.0,30,7,2021,1,0,"The phone is great, the performance is optimum.The geekbech scores improve if you turn on the high performance mode in battery optimisation (for those who want the scores to roar)The display is crisp, albeit a little dim for outdoors but that's a known thing since OnePlus clearly mentioned the peak display brightness.Netflix HDR Support is still missing.A few glitches post the software update, like the app cloner (Parallel apps as per previous OnePlus OS on my OP3T) fails to detect whatapp and other apps, I had to reset the phone to fix the issue.The support for the device on OnePlus app is still missing, no extended warranty for this under the red cable club as of now.The back glass (the logo on it to be precise) is layered for texture, in my case the logo is not perfectly aligned and thus gives this weird look. Refer the images below. I have raised the request to amazon regarding this waiting to see if I can get a replacement for it. Will keep everyone posted.Edit 1:1. The phones has some weird software or hardware issue(Tough to pin point as of now)2. The apps keep running out of memory, the apps keep crashing(even the phone app) so high number of call drops.3. Seems like a half baked product rolled out to hurry and match Oppo's Reno 6 Launch."
354,Aniket jawalkar,Extremely disappointed,1.0,23,1,2022,1,1,"When I bought this phone, I had high expectations. It is Onplus product afterall. But after I started using it, I realised it is no more than a Redmi phone. All the applications are taken from redmi and Mi. Does not fuction properly.Has many issues in camera, and phone app.It does not feel like a premium profuct. It is been less than 2 months, and I want to change my phone.Extremely disappointed with the product. Will never buy the Onplus phone again."
355,Mayank,Great smartphone for risk takers,4.0,4,10,2021,1,1,"With the news of Nord 2s getting blasted every 3rd week, it sure bothers me when I put it in my pocket or when it gets a little hot while gaming. And the battery life is okayish as well. It will get you through a full day in low-moderate use. But the plus point is that it charges SUUPPEERRR quick. I mean I'm really really impressed with the charging speed (half and hour and it's done, 0-100). Other than that everything else is good, indoor camers quality is excellent, outdoor quality is above average. Processor is lag free. Ram management is excellent. Go for it if you can deal with the blasting problem and all"
356,AAYUSH SHARMA,Not a flagship killer but good for normal usage.,4.0,29,8,2021,1,1,"I am using nord2 for last 1 month. Also I don't play any games on this device. Charges very quickly(25 mins) and lasts almost a day. The fingerprint scanner is poor. Front camera is average. The rear camera is excellent. It has ufs 3.1 storage but doesn't seem very fast. No headphone jack(disappointing). The processor is ok but not as good as a flagship killer. Brightness is not sufficient(too low) for outdoor usage. Frankly I am not so impressed with any of the features. The only selling point would be the OnePlus branding and fast charging. Yes the build quality is good. You can check the low light camera performance in the images I've uploaded, it's wonderful.In a nutshell, there are too many comprises for ₹30000. You can go for IQOO7 for this range."
357,Vibhor Shrivastava,Good Camera poor battery life,3.0,11,10,2021,1,1,"If good camera is your priority, like in my case, then this is a good choice, although with a catch - picture qualities are superb, but if you take videos, the phone heats up pretty quickly.Battery charging is superfast, but even with normal use of watching videos or insta, it lasts for about 6-7 hours only, which I believe should not be the case.To Sum Up-Camera - 5/5Battery - 1/5Charging - 5/5Performance - 2/5 ( due to the heating issue)*It once got heated during data backup on drive, to a point that both front and back sides were hot enough for me to shut it down immediately.But I am still going to use it for the camera for atleast one year. Hoping, issues gets fixed in updates."
358,Mahesh,Not upto OnePlus mark,3.0,31,7,2021,1,1,"This is my first OnePlus mobile. Before this I am a samsung member. But as I expect from OnePlus I get disappointed about software. Need so much update. I buy this mobile in first sale. As of now I notice these qualities in this mobile.Pros:-1. Charging speed ( full charging in 45min from 0 to 100)2. Performance is super fast (I am not a gamer)3. Speakers4. Screen looks cool5. InDisplay Finger print reader6. No heating issue, while charging as well as using time.Cons:-1. Selfie camera ( as a samsung member I feel disappointed about the camera even though they said it's 32mp but it's not perform like that)2. Charging drain little faster3. Clone app not working4. Music player missing5. Calling app ( I personally don't like it)6. And some widgets and cool features are missing like., Charging animation, clear cache, battery usage graph.This is my experience as of now. But it seems all cons are under software category. So we hope they can fix in next software update."
359,Aniruddha Aserkar,A Very Good Phone,5.0,19,8,2021,1,1,"The phone looks amazing and is light weight.Performance of the phone is as expected and very good for this price range.Display is very Rich,Battery life is good and the phone charges fast because of the warp charger.Camera is very good.I purchased this phone in the exchange of the old one, so all the features I am getting in this price range is above expectation & nothing to complain about"
360,RoM,Thank you Amazon ❤️,4.0,31,7,2021,1,1,Just received the One plus Nord 2. It's look really beautiful and the performance is also actually great! And the battery backup is not like I expect but OK.And there is something like a manufacturering defect on the side of the plastic frame there is small potion where the is this damaged black mark. I know it's a small damage but my 100% happy lvl turns to 50% just after I noticed this.Everything was perfect but only this issue so spoke with an Amazon customer service and a replacement is on the way. Thank you Amazon for you prompt support :)
361,Ayush K.,The phone is great.,5.0,3,9,2021,1,1,"Camera:As someone who loves a good camera and processor, this phone meets expectations. However thr front camers defaults to a bit higher exposure that you need to tap and correct sometimes. Should be fixed with a software update.OS:Many are complaining that Oxygen OS doesn't feel the same, but in my opinion, it doesn't matter.What you have in this phone is a very smooth experience for any of your tasks.Thr battery:The battery charges CRAZY fast!!It does last a day for me for medium usage."
362,prashanth,Overall Decent Mobile,2.0,5,8,2021,1,1,I brought this on first day of the sale and it is performing decent as of now. Update: camera is worrest..if you love taking photos stay away.Pros:Oxygen OSGaming is excellentSound is clear and loudBattery charging speed and backup is excellentDisplay is awesomeCall quality and network reception is goodCons:Camera is worrestStains of Colored OSSometimes sound is too loud on Insta reelsNo 3.5 m headphone jackBugs in the software ( can be fixed in future updates)Overall a decent mobile for daily use and gaming and good for watching movies .
363,Rakesh,"Good buy, satisfied",4.0,2,8,2021,1,1,"Worth every penny. Battery seems to be draining out soon, however fast charger masks this deficiency. Picture quality is awesome, camera is good, needs some software fixing. The edges in the protrait mode is blurry, hopefully updates fixes all these issues. If company had provided more themes and live wallpapers it would have been good. Even the AOD screen have very limited options for customisation. Hardware wise it has a very good built quality and feels really premium. Feels easy to use and nonlag at all. I'm liking it so far. Phone seems to heat up during charging. It could be because of 65W fast charger. Sound quality is crystal clear and loud. Haven't tried call quality with earphones. Overall a good buy if One plus could release update soon and fix minor issues , it's gonna be a real deal in this price segment."
364,krupa,Mid segment champion,5.0,3,10,2021,1,0,It meets all requirements of above normal  mobile user! Using from few days and haven’t seen any issues so far. Greenwood is very nice to carry without cover. Mediatek may be next big competitor!1. Fortnite 30fps good2. Pubg HD Very good3.COD butter smooth4. Charging super fast so don’t worry if power drains little faster! As long as you don’t do trekking every day5. 90hz is more than enough unless you won’t satisfy at 90 and needs full 😁6. Display is sharp and crisp unless you sit and compare for the sake of show off.
365,Sanjeeb Patra,In Lunch event Main high light was Camera. But Camera performance is too too baf,2.0,29,7,2021,1,2,I am totally unsatisfied with the Camera performance. In lunch event Main high light was Camera. Camera software is also of OPPO. only name is Oneplus but maximum software is of OPPO.Performance of the Handset is good not excellent.Should go for Poco f3 gt
366,Srikanth,"Very sad to say OnePlus is Mirging to Colour Os , it's not pure Oxygen Os , Is it's Colour Os",3.0,6,11,2021,1,1,"Pros :1) Dimendcity 1200 is Excellent2) Sound quality Good3) Optik Vibration Excellent4) 65 Wrap Charge Excellent5) Disigne Build quality SuperCons:1) Battery Decent2) it's not pure Oxygen Os3) Display quality Average4) Display peak Brightness Worst, Very low Brighten indore and outdoor5) phone length is too high6) Picture resolution is Worstif u buy this phone, carefully read this.It's not pure OnePlus Mobile, and Oxygen Os. it's Oppo mobile."
367,Abhisek Basu Mullick,Flagship like performance,4.0,19,8,2021,1,0,"From performance perspective this device is as good as any flagship phone in the market. Like any other Oneplus phone it has got a clean, smooth user interface. But looks like the OS needs more patches as the screen gets frozen at times.The charger I received was faulty. It stops working and then a few pats on the converter brings the life back.Otherwise I am impressed by the warp speed of charging. It takes just half an hour time to complete 0 to 100% charging.Mediatek 1200-AI SOC is blazing fast and 12 GB complements to it.However the device still doesn't support Google Augmented Reality."
368,prashant,All Ok in 30k,3.0,24,8,2021,1,1,"Hi I am posting this review after using of 20 days of my use.Phone has below pros and cons#Pros :1. Awesome battery life and charge time2. Slim, Handy and light weight3. Back Camera setup is good and specially flash 📸 system is much better in this range phone#Cons:1. Lag in phone use2. Finger sensor has issue with angle while we tapping finger it should be in strait position so it not accept it from horizon3. Throughout the WhatsApp you can't access gallery folders. You just access gallery as plain photos recent.4. Sometimes WhatsApp videos are not saving in gallery.Overall phone is good in this price rangeAlternate suggestionGo for Oppo Reno 6"
369,Ruben L.,Review,4.0,9,8,2021,1,1,"What I immediately noticed in this device is  one weakness that is battery optimization is not precise ,I use AccuBattery Pro for battery data ,and i have noticed that battery doesn't hold up well ,The device will certainly give a full day with normal use but under heavy and normal use ,you might have to juice it up twice . I recommend charging the battery to ,90% and not any further to reduce wear and tear and not letting the battery go less that 15%.Camera✓ wide angle is averageSensors✓Brightness could have been betterPerformance✓Call quality✓Carrier aggregation✓Software updates (June)Build quality✓In hand feel-premium ✓Clean UI✓Battery ( could have been better)Hoping the future updates will fix it.09-08-21"
370,Latish Lal,Not worth price tag,3.0,9,10,2021,1,1,"Hi, the review is post 2 days of usage.Finger print sensor / face unlock are super quick. Camera both backa and front are good.Apart from these phone is just average, battery drains our rapidly (on 60hz / dark theme) it lasted just 9 hours with not much calling and heavy games.Sound of phone is reasonable.Out of 2 sims only sim1 is catching up 4g , sim2 does not get data connect at all (may be defect with my handset and shall be raising a ticket for the same)Not worth the price tag of INR 28k."
371,Manish,30k phone not value provide .,2.0,18,10,2021,1,1,This phone was like 15k phone . Media take process was very slow fornt camera bed (white and blary ) f/camera is very bad performance .I think I was pubg last 2 months not very High performance it's like 18k phone .I was compare Nord 2 vs poco x3 poco Snapdragon processor is very fast and smooth .I am not certified with Nord 2One plus is very bed phone lunch  this price I think this phone best value for 22k .(30k is over price .) .I was used last 3 month2nd think battery performance is week only 2hr backup .

372,P Garg,"Software needs a refresh, low on user experience",3.0,1,8,2021,1,1,"Nord2 look and feel is very good, working has been good for first few hours.Camera is good as wellHowever 2nd day onwards, issues started popping up- App crashes frequent, happening with multiple app- No cloning- Unusual storage full warnings, despite it is just 20% use- Battery drains very fast, only respite is that it charges very very fast.- Needs a serious software refresh, not expected this experience with this range of phone"
373,Vedant Singh,I got defective mobile. The video camera isn't working well.,1.0,13,8,2021,1,1,"I got defective mobile. Its video camera doesn't work well. You will get red dots in videos.Pros:Turbocharger ( Full charge under 30 min )Rear Camera ( Video camera stabilisation, AI mode, etc )ConnectivityCons:Selfie camera ( Very cheap quality in this price range )Battery drain ( if you are using 90Hz display and normal mode. Very little chance that it's going to last for a day )90Hz display ( It could have been better )Overall:You can get the same specifications in phones which are lower in price.Not worth."
374,Chandra Prakash,Please don't waste your money. This is average phone.,1.0,11,8,2021,1,1,"This doesn't meet the expectations one plus has set in past.. I have used one plus 7 before and that phone still beats Nord 2 in every corner like camera, battery and sound. Battery charges very fast but drains too with pace which is not the case with one plus 7. Face unlock doesn't works most of the time. And lastly you need to give 100 kinds of different access permissions.After a months use found there are too much ads in this OS."
375,SREEDEVI M KARTHA,Average. High cost.Not good not too bad.,4.0,9,1,2022,1,0,"Liked its camera, sound quality and storage capacity.But battery drains easily, not സ്ലിം and the worst is the call recording feature which intimates the other person, whose call is being recorded. Why company is installing this feature without customers consent.How can we keep privacy while recording the call. The next problem is non detection of usb. Everytime we have to remove the phonecase and insert. The company should correct all these."
376,Suryakiran Madugu,Worst phone I ever buy,1.0,23,8,2021,1,1,Worst and worst phone total 35k .waste no proper maintenance in one plus Nord 2 phones . I just used 1 days lots of issues raised from mobile even 10k cost redmi phone better than these phone please don't buy these phone. if u buy same situation coming to you also.main phone problem I have faced from Nord 2 mobile after usage of 1 day1)Not working power button2) Not working double tap lock3) even phone also not lock4) battery also drain only 1hr completelyMy sister brought for these phone for rakshabandhan gift for me but she also very disappointed even I tried return these phone but Amazon closed option 5days from the delivery date of the phone.
377,Raj,Excellent camera,4.0,7,10,2021,1,2,Writing this after a month use. Gotta say camera quality is awesome. But front camera isn't that good just okiesg. Overall phone perform very well. Green wood color is amazing.
378,Anant J.,Best Phone if you’re looking at this price range,5.0,5,8,2021,1,1,Best phone in this price range as the processor is mediatek density 1200D which is comparable to Snapdragon 870 which is quite good as snapdragon 870 is a very fast processor also the 65 watt warp charge is best the phone gets charged from 30% to 100% in just 15-20 minutes and overall very nice phone
379,Faiz,Not a value for money,2.0,31,8,2021,1,0,"So after using it for some day below are my comments, I will only talk about negative points. it is simply not a value for money phone.1) so brightness nits are only 600, which means when you will see any video you will feel a difference I compared it with my ONE PLUS7T and really did not liked the brightness level, from a brand like one plus I never expected this, with 600 nits brightness AMOLED display make no sense. and also on a price of 30000.2) Mediatek process not a a value for money again as it gets heat while charging.3) Oxygen OS, who said it is Oxygen OS only look is same but there is  a big difference between Oxygen OS and the OS what Nord2 have, so one plus was known for Oxygen OS but now a days one plus has given me a great disappointment."
380,Vijay Chaudhary,Superb value for money phone with allround performance.,5.0,27,8,2021,1,1,"I ordered this phone on 7th aug after lot of research and soon the first news of nord 2 blast came from banglore, it was ok upto this as it was a single phone blast news and it could be due to many factors but on 10th aug another news came and this time i was totally confused whether to cancel my order as it was arriving on 12th aug, i researched a lot through youtube videos and other sources and it turned out to be a fake news. So i didn't cancelled my order and it arrived on 12th aug.First impression was great as the phone was light weight and super handy and the grey colour with the matt finish on the back looks super premium.After using for 15 days now i am reviewing this device on my own experience.Camera- the big highlight of this phone was it's camera and it performed upto the mark, my first priority was the camera and it fulfilled my expectation, the main as well as the front camera is superb in almost every conditions.Battery- when the phone arrived, the only cons which i noticed was the battery drainage, it hardly lasts a day, i charged my phone in the morning and in the evening i had to charge it again(i am not a gamer). But after 3-4 days(after auto update) it improved and i started getting better results (more than 7hrs+ screen on time). so now i am fully satisfied with the battery also.Performance- I am not the right person to talk about this, as neither i play games nor do i do heavy tasks like editing, etc., but for normal usage i didn't face any issue and it's super responsive.Design & Built-  It feels premium and the camera module looks attractive, build quality is also good.OS Experience- this is my first OnePlus device and i am impressed with the user interface, the UI is clean and smooth.Charging- 2nd main highlight after the camera is the charging speed of this phone and yes it is super fast it gets fully charged from 0-100% under 35 minsDisplay- this is the only field which could have been improved and that is the brightness of the display, in indoor condition it is good but in outdoor sunlight sometimes it feels less brighter, though it's not a big issue.Overall this is a great package with allround performance (i was waiting for last 6 months for a phone with allround performance under 30k and i got one and am fully satisfied with it), it is a value for money phone and i highly recommend this phone if you are looking for a phone between 25k- 40k"
381,Prasun Paul,Really satisfied with this phone,5.0,6,9,2021,1,0,"This phone is worth the wait I had to do for the Green Woods version. The back texture feels so good to touch. The screen is appropriately lit and does a good job of adjusting according to the ambient light. The cameras are great and captures pictures exceptionally well. The phone is fast, and light in weight. The warp charge actually charges in less than 30 mins. I would have hoped the charge lasted more, but with the usage comes more battery use. Highly recommended."
382,sanjiv singh,Not value for money @ 30000,3.0,14,10,2021,1,0,Phone look is premium.Camera - not that good for the price range of 30000Display - not as good as samsung amoled.Os/UI - Good and smooth( non laggy) but there's some issue like unable to find storage path for any andriod application.Unable to access various test with secret code. EtcBattery life - average (less than a day with average use)Phone gets reboot own it own .
383,Devesh,"Overall Good phone , but not recommended for business users",4.0,25,8,2021,1,1,"The phone is smooth120Hz is never an issue ,90Hz is good if you come from 60Hz.Camera is good ,but there is no sharpening in imageImage got quite blurt while zoom ,may be update fix it.For business users call recording is important ,it has but it prompts users being recorded.Also note that 3rd party recorder apps will not work by any means bcz of high Google security.(Don't fall for fake YouTube videos)If above two is not issue then it's perfect phone with great performance and bloatware free with so many features."
384,Jayu,GOOD PHONE BUT HAS SOME ISSYUS,3.0,2,8,2021,1,3,* BETTRY DRAINING FAST GOOD PART IS CHARGING ALSO FAST* HEATING UP QUICKLY* IN COMING VOICE CALL TOO SHARP AND LOUD NOT GOOD FOR EARS* APPS SHUT DOWN AUTOMATICALLY MANY TIMES
385,Tanmoy Purkait,Pretty much everything!,3.0,9,8,2021,1,1,Being habitual but here are some updates over my last two weeks usage! Was skeptical about mediatek 1200 but overall perf is okay to me.Pros:- Good lightweight design - fit in one hand.- Fast charging- 0-100% in approx. 35 min- Rear camera is okay- NFCCons:- Heating issue in average usuage sometimes- Battery draining - should have been more optimized.- Lot of S/W glitches esp. with Microsoft apps..improved little bit after latest update.- No inbuilt bluetooth audio tuner - disabled!- Sometimes it feels slow opening apps.
386,Leo V.,Waited for almost 10 days to order on the release day. 1st time OnePlus user 😍💃🏻,4.0,16,8,2021,1,1,"Oxygen OS is really great to use, as a 1st time user I love a lot.Camera- expected a lot from picture quality, but didn't amazed me as much, but 4k videos are great., expected Milky way timelapse mode in this update, but they didn't provide this feature 😓Battery- fast charging is awesome 🔥 15-100% tooks almost 35 minutes. Battery life is about to withstand for a one-day use., drains quickly if we played games continuously.Performance- Phone doesn't lags, no glitches as of now except a small delay in fingerprint sensor, no heating issues, ultimate speed, smooth display. Face unlock is lit 👌🏼Worth to buy in this budget 😃🙌🏼"
387,Advocate Md Tanweer Arshad,"Battery capacity is not good, Phone heats too much.delivery was given after 10 days delay",1.0,31,8,2021,1,1,Battery capacity is not good but fast charging maintains it. Zooming is not good. Phone heats too much. Sometimes it lags even back key doesn't work. Overall too costly phone as per specifications. 17000/- price would be enough. Overall don't purchase this mobile. Amazon is worst in delivery. After failure dates delivery was given after 10 days. Now within a month camera crashes during video call and your grievances will not be entertained by One Plus.
388,Faizan khan,I picked this phone just bcz of its charging technology and bcz of colored oxygen( not bad) .,5.0,25,8,2021,1,1,"I would prefer this mobile phone to those who are not a heavy gamer or user. Main feature of this mobile is its charging speed, it gets charged in approx 38 min (0-100%) which is very fast and it gives a one day of battery back up if you use it normally. It won't give you 2-3 hours of nonstop gaming, if you are a gamer or heavy user then you have to charge it for two times a day, but bcz of its charging technology the battery back up doesn't even matter to me. I play bgmi and the mobile performance is very good. If you are looking for a all in one mobile phone under 30k then this is the one for you. You will see many negative reviews of this mobile but I loved this very mobile much. And mainly it's UI is very clean 👍."
389,Mudita Srivastava,Awesome buy.,5.0,28,7,2021,1,1,Great phone with great features. Good Camera resolution. Nice gaming experience although few games are not optimised for the best gaming experience. Backed by performance. Finally I’ll call it a value for money product.Also Amazon delivery was super fast. Thankyou Amazon .
390,Sangram,This is a very good phone for working professionals.,5.0,12,8,2021,1,1,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Here is my review after 15 days of using this phone.Pros1 - Good and vibrant display, 120 hrz is overrated. 90 hrz is enough for a daily drive phone.2 - Sound output from the speaker is absolutely amazing.3 - Desing and looks fantastic and in-hand feeling is premium.4 - Absolutely no lag in day-to-day usage.5 - Network and connectivity is in flagship-grade6 - Smooth gaming in lower settings absolute no lag.7 - Flagship grade main camera.8 - Haptic is Awesome9 - No issues with UI even after color os integration.10 - 5g band is more and good 4g+Cons1 - Front-facing camera need improvement.2 - No 3.5 mm audio jack. is a scam.3 - 4k HRD at 60 fps bit laggy and not smooth4 - Phone get hot in higher setting gameplay5 - Chin could be less.6 - Ultrawide camera overwhelming.Conclusion  - If you are a person looking for a good camera, good in hand feeling, good battery backup, gaming maximum of 2 hours a day, content consumption in ott, smooth day-to-day use. Trust me this is the value for money by one plus. I Will not recommend heavy gaming. This is a very good phone for working professionals."
391,Ashish,Awesome Phone,4.0,7,8,2021,1,1,"Hello people, this is my 1st oneplus mobile, and this is awesome mobile with great features and best thing is this it has now updated with new things that are very good as compare to other oneplus mobiles, like more 5g band support, better camera features, screen refresh rate..... and many more...Till now after 5 days of usage phone is good and very premium, hope it works well in future too.............................................................................................."
392,Yash Baldawa,You get what you expect,5.0,19,8,2021,1,0,"I purchased this phone recently and the phone was delivered on time. The phone was quiet nicely packed and the phone quality was what displayed as per specifications. I like this smartphone as Oneplus never disappoints with any feature, we get what we expect. When I started the phone, I received an update where they include many camera and UI improvements. The phone doesn't includes any bloatware third party apps and further the Oxygen OS is clean. I also really like the whole screen dark mode and a slider to the side to make phone Silent, Vibrate or in Ring mode. I would recommend this phone to all users who likes the Android space and premium phones. Go for it. Thank you Oneplus and Amazon."
393,sudarsan nath,Only name and price high,1.0,8,8,2021,1,1,Only price high and brand name attract to people other wise nothing any special in this mobile. Such as MMX IN B JUST HATKE LIKE UNISOC PROCCER AND STOCK ANDROID .but I did not seen any information new in oneplus nord.I think better Indian Mobile micromax
394,Sanjay,One Plus Nord 2 Review,3.0,18,10,2021,1,1,"Overall the Mobile is good and have so much features to offer to us but it also have 2 Most Disappointing things for me. First is it's Battery life. Battery drains too fast as it charges too fast. Used it in all possible ways to test the battery life but it drains very fast despite the company's claim. Second thing I dislike the most is that when we started Call recording someone's call it sounds ""XYZ has started recording this call and Stops Recording this call"" respectively to the other speaker whose call we want to record. That's most disappointing feature. What's the purpose of call recording if it louds this to them."
395,Suraj Shaikh,Worst products! Don't buy this phone,1.0,30,8,2021,1,0,I order OnePlus Nord2 almost it's been 2week I am using this phone as my experience is worst on this flagship ever.The issue I got as follows.1. Heating issues.2. Battery drain every fast on less usage.3. Lag problem as I order 12 ram veriant seriously guys. My old phone was 6gb ram compair with this that phone was running smoothly.4. When ever I got calls phone screen freezes and had to restart it.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!GO FOR OTHER BARNDS I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED ON ONEPLUS PRODUCTS
396,Chandrakant,Not so good,3.0,12,10,2021,1,0,Writing the review after using for 2 months.Earlier I used Realme U1 and seriously that phone was way better than this phone and also 3 times less costly.So writing the review in comparison with my earlier phone.Pro1. Phone looks premium2. Warp charger is fast and awesomeCons1. Selfie sucks. Quality is utterly bad bad bad2. The phone is heavy and also slippery. So cant chat for long.3. Finger print reader is laggy and also does not work properly.
397,Nagalakshmi,Good phone,4.0,12,8,2021,1,0,"I have thought of having one plus brand phone and it was dream come true with one plus nord 2 release. i have used this phone  for almost 3 weeks and here is my opinion.I am a medium phone user, complete phone is superb. Camera is excellent. I loved the pics. Quick charging for 100% battery.Only 1 thing i observed was - battery life - maximum 1 day it comes for 1 charging with minimum usage.If oneplus quickly fixes it, it would be a wonderful phone.Thanks OnePlus, Thanks Amazon for quick delivery on the same day."
398,Nevil,Good productive phone with all the right features and appropriate sacrifices,4.0,4,10,2021,1,1,"Nors 2 might not be the best the phone out there at this price segment. But its one of the better phones and also the best choice if you are not an avid gamer. Of course sacrifices are made at certain aspects, which i believe is necessary to provide the phone at this price point. However those features which are sacrificed are the ones we can live without and still have a really wonderful phone at hand . It has all the necessary feautres that a regular medium usage. I have been using the phone for 1 and half months and have no real complaints.In short its a jack of all trades and still master of some."
399,Shyam Gajra,Great phone with some bugs,3.0,26,8,2021,1,1,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   It's good device but because of bugs in ui it's irrated sometimesCamera app is laggy and I have to swipe 4-5 time to close the app and some time on other apps also I have to swipe 4-5 timeGcam also lag and front camera preety averageStereo speaker is good but don't know in video call and phone speaker volume is low.Games work smoothly didn't faced any issues in gamingMain camera is good in outside but indoor its avg.Night mode photos are amazingDisplay is above avg not mind-blowing or nor badFinger print works fineCharging speed is amazing and battery life is also decent like other phones in this range It gives 7-8hrs SOT.Sometimes 4k HDR lag in youtube and on Netflix and Amazon prime HDR is missing.It's decent phone not mind blowing or nor badIf this bugs fixed than its amazing phone."
400,Harsh Ajmera,Flagship Killer,5.0,29,7,2021,1,3,Awesome buildAwesome cameraAwesome battery n quick charging9 5G bandsGood processorSimply go for it
401,Madhu Badisha,Battery life is the weakest point,3.0,2,8,2021,1,1,"Doesn't matter how good the phone is, without good battery life, it is nothing. You hardly get 3.5 hours of screen on time with screen set to 90Hz and Always on displayMy brother's Galaxy A52 with similar display and exact battery capacity givs 1.5 days of battery life with medium usage and atleast 1 day of battery life with heavy usage. I raised this issue with OnePlus, but they did not fix it yet. If you are a person who hates charing phone several times a day, then this phone is not for you"
402,pankaj,"Not Worth it for 30k , don't waste money",2.0,6,1,2022,1,0,"1. 50 MP camera is not worth it for 30k and Quality is Worst than Redmi & samsung 13 MP camera. i saw many reviews and comparisons but didn't help.2. Battery 🔋 is worst like 4500mah for Big smartphone . I need to charge 2 Times in a day even I do work 8 hours office work. I mean its only 25 days and battery drain 30% to 20% over night while sleeping.3. I didn't believe this phone blast but last migh I was playing BGMI woth normal graphic settings and it became to much hot 🔥🔥 in 2 games So I thought I need wrote this review. Hope it helps.One thing I have decided Buy iPhone or Budget phone 20k, never go for middle range."
403,Amazon Customer,Downgrading phone from OnePlus,1.0,3,9,2021,1,2,"Phone UI is not to the mark.. it shouldn't placed under OnePlus brand.. My last phone was OnePlus 6 which is very smooth & UI is top notch. The 3 years old phone has better options than oneplus nord2.Simple features like Message grouping, auto call recording options are very pathetic in nord2. Highly disappointed."
404,Utraskh,Great Device,5.0,19,1,2022,1,1,"It tries to give the feel of a premium flagship device at half the price. Specifications are good, no doubt on that. Overall it definitely worth considering and better than the likes of Mi unless getting an IR blaster is very important to you. Didn't compare with IQOO series but both are kind of similar. IQOO does have a lot of offers for buyers but this one feels more reasonable to buy. Thanks!"
405,Amazon Customer,Worst Phone have ever used..,1.0,4,9,2021,1,3,"This is the worst segment of One Plus till date. I bought Nord 2 in month of August 2021, Since, then i was literally crying to waste my money on this handset. I do have trust on ONE Plus, hence I ordered this handset from Amazon. B"
406,Anchal,Worth the price....!,4.0,7,1,2022,1,2,"Finger print sometimes get stuck, however face recognition is really good. Battery life is good too and best part no need to wait for an hour or two to get it charged as the phone gets charged very fast. Some apps doesn't get open in one go and need to restart the app in that case. Overall the phone is good and smooth."
407,Rahul,Lived upto the expectations,4.0,11,8,2021,1,0,"This is my first Oneplus device. Maybe I may not give accurate review as other OnePlus users. But this phone has lived up to his expectations. In terms of Camera, UI (Heard that Color Os has been merged in this but still a new user so didn't know much of a difference) , Performance , Hardware smoothness amd everything. The only thing that it has not good at its the battery life. It drains pretty fast untill and unless you put it on Battery saving mode. Which wil last long till 1 and half day. Even though I used data net and used hotspot on this device still it last for a day and half so it's good but only when put on to the battery saving mode. Otherwise Nope. Overall it's good phone with everything you could've asked for. But not the battery life though"
408,harshita,Good phone with brilliant camera,5.0,8,8,2021,1,1,"I'm writing this review after using the phone for a week. I ordered grey 8GB 128GB.Starting with look, it's really sleek, not much in weight and good grip. Performance is very smooth even if you are using multiple applications at a time. Sound is terrific.Camera is brilliant. The eagle pic was clicked at 10x zoom"
409,Arun nivethan,⭐⭐⭐⭐,4.0,23,8,2021,1,1,"This is my first ONEPLUS❤️! I received it a day before it should have been delivered ,I have been using this since more than a month now what is very impressive is it's battery performance it changes 0 to 100 in less then halfen hour and stands by a day ⁵/⁵, and the camera performance is good 4/⁵ and what is worst is It has thermal issue it will heat up when you take this out under sun light it is extremely heating when the phone is leftover on car's dashboard and when you play BGMI with high performance mode on it heats a lot ⅗ . After the blast insident i fear a lot which makes this even worst🙄 I don't know can they fix this with a software update or it's a hardware bug . But other than this my Sierra grey 12/256gb Nord 2 is performing good⭐⭐⭐⭐ but if you ask mewill you buy 1+ next time?A BIG NO!!!"
410,avictor,Overheating & Wrap Battery drain,1.0,30,7,2021,1,4,"Within 2-3 hours of usage, battery is draining by 30%. And without any usage in night, 60% charge is getting drained."
411,Amit,Review about OnePlus Nord 2,3.0,30,7,2021,1,1,"After buy this phone i experienced that we should not buy any product after watching such paid or who is getting free devices from Oneplus and giving reviews.So, You will never feel like a Premium phone. Not at all. It's cost is under 30k and it seems OnePlus has taken devices from Oppo which is the same company for mid range market and they pasted OnePlus logo.. that'it.If you want same experience then go and buy Oppo mobile 20-25k range and you will get same or better experience..just you will see difference OnePlus logo vs Oppo logo. Not anything else. Really.Disappointed on this phone as it cost should not be more than 23k.Screen resolution is very low .. OnePlus Pro series is the best another all are worst quality.But Pro series they are providing too costly.If you are a fan of OnePlus logo then you should go for it else Resmi is also better option in this price range."

   Worst front camera, 8mp camera would be better than this one.Performance is good.Screen flickering is observed certain times.Really disappointed with oneplus.Even after replacement same issue in the new mobile"
413,subhadip karmakar,Reliable daily driver,5.0,30,8,2021,1,0,Using the phone for a week now. Feels very snappy and responsive especially when you shift  from samsung phones😂 I'm that kind of user who use the phone a lot for my work like checking mails and lots of calling and video meeting and documents reading writing. I also play pubg for 1hr on avg everyday and yet this phone makes me through 8am charging to next day 8am with 20 percent of juice remaining and also it is worth mentioning that this gets 20 to 100 during my bathing and breakfast period of 30 mins. BGMI goes smooth enough for me as like other tasks. About Camera I feel I expected better from youtube reviews but not getting that good results. Maybe need more time to explore the optics. Finally I'm a satisfied customer with this op device.
414,Gayatri,Heating and battery life,3.0,3,9,2021,1,1,This phone heats up for a little usage and the battery gets consumed very fast even for minimal browsing. Not so special except for larger storage and finger print thing. It doesn't have a 3.5 mm jack. So one cannot listen to music or participate in meeting wuitely unless you buy the adapter again ! The sound quality is very good and the camera gets all the details that even minute cracks that you won't want is also seen in your pic. I would not say value for money.
415,Wasim,Overheating issue bad performance,1.0,24,11,2021,1,2,"Due to overheating issue I had returned the phone,It's been over a month now I haven't got the refund,As well as everytime customer executive false commitment, I have pissed off allof this. There's a return refund policy of 2-3 days today it's been over a month now.Now I am going to take legal action against you guys."
416,Srk,Excellent,5.0,8,8,2021,1,1,Very comfortable phone to hold ..stylish ..Speaker sound while watching YouTube is very loud and clear ..Good software experience..UI is just great ... don't mix color OS with Oxygen OS ..that's my simple suggestion to oneplusOtherwise  phone is simply great
417,Maqsood Baig Mirza,Overall phone is great but has some small issues!,4.0,30,12,2021,1,1,"Phone is overall great with good battery backup, ok camera but I found some issues like when I'm over the call and remove the phone from the ear the phone goes black i.e it's not locked yet i cannot operate it for few minutes. Also WhatsApp notifications doesn't clear sometimes and I need to clear one by one."
418,Anish Samtani,"This one's a clear winner, look no further!",5.0,31,7,2021,1,2,"• 100% Charge in 20mins! Runs the entire day after that.• Superb camera. Great clarity!• Premium Built quality• The speakers on this phone are real badass.• Smooth like butter at 8GB RAM!• Built in alexa, love this feature!• The viewing angles are greatIn 30k this is the best phone out there! 💯"
419,Rishabhraj Pahare,Great product better than past Nord 1. But with some complexes.,4.0,1,8,2021,1,0,"Nord 2 excellent phone . But buy if you can avail offer and get it on at a price around 26k or 25k. I won't recommend it buying at 30k. If you are purchasing it around 30k than go fir iqoo7. This is an excellent upgrade in all aspects from nord1. Good fast charging, haptics are awsm, durability is good. Performance is also good but if you are heavy gamer than go for poco gt. But in all around aspects go for Nord 2"
420,sakir,Better than expected,4.0,1,9,2021,1,2,I waited for green wood colour and I am really happy that I did. Green colour looks stunning with that leathery back. Battery backup not bad since I'm not a gamer. Camera impressive lots of options. Only issue I found is that display is not very bright and HDR not supported on Netflix.
421,Aanand Jog,Overall not upto the mark,3.0,19,12,2021,1,1,"One plus has to keep it's quality best. But they failed to do it with this phone. My gorilla glass started unsticking from one side. Rest also not up to the mark. Previously I was having 1+3t, it was a nice phone but this phone does not satisfied me."
422,Purnendu Chakrabarty,Expected much more than this,3.0,19,8,2021,1,1,I've been using the device since last one month.Overall experience was pretty decent.Built quality is good front side and back side are made of glass. But frame is made of plastic.Finger print and facelock works smoothly.Lets talk about the camera of this deviceCamera is decent but the UI is not that good. Shutter speed is pretty smooth but camera quality is not good enough considering the specs and price point. It automatically applies beauty mode on the human subjects which is a major setback of this device i think. And the selfie shooter is also good in outdoor conditions but in low light it captures less details.Battery performance is quite impressive it lasts almost a day on heavy usage. Overall connectivity and if you ask me about the speed i would say I'm satisfied with the overall speed and performance.Dear one plus team please improve camera performance.
423,Kedar Nath Tripathi,Auto call record is absent for saved number.,3.0,12,8,2021,1,1,I dislike product because there is lack of many programs such as there no auto call recorder for saved numbers and for unknown numbers it speaks loudly that your call is being recorded.Selfie camera is not good as per the expected 32 megapixel camera. File manager is not in a proper way so that you could find your send or receive files on telegram and WhatsApp app. As I am first time user I am unhappy with performance till now after 10 days of use. Though I can replace my mobile within the period but I was checking it so that in future I should buy updated version of oneplus or not.My e-mail address is -knt1.goodboy@gmail.com
424,Anirban Paul,The perfect phone in 30k range considering the brand value,5.0,3,8,2021,1,1,"After 3 days of use!!1. Took some some to complete the initial updates!2. Once initial updates are completed, you can't fasten your belt and start the amazing journey.3. Really easy to transfer data and contacts from old phone to Nord.4. Amazing fingerprint and face unlock system.5. Sound quality is just superb with dual speaker!!6. Charges really fast!! With data on, it charged 40% in 12 mins.7. Camera is again!! Pretty cool.. though it could've been a little better!!Overall, it's a really awesome buy in 35k.Thanks to my HDFC offer, got a discount nof ₹1750"
425,sara Iqbal,Worst experience of OnePlus,3.0,10,8,2021,1,1,Firstly I heard a lot about OnePlus and even used OnePlus 6t which was fab.But after buying with 24hrs of use I feel it's s wasteBattery gets drained 50% within 2-4 hrs without using any gaming app or entertainment appsFingerprint reader doesn't detect easily which is very frustratingCompletely disappointed

   I'm changing my review after using around 5months and had a very great time with this monster.Here are my few observations after using 5months.CAMERA:- You can see the pictures in my review if you are considered with camera. 4.5/5PERFORMANCE:- I don't have any much technical knowledge on mobiles,but the way when i using this devil it makes me feel soo comfortable. 4.5/5GAMING:- When i played game battery is like holding for 4-6 hours till it get drain. 4/5BATTERY:- Here it comes the main part. when you are in journey if you feel like you phone got drained, when a bus stop for 5mnts even it is more for this, within 5mnts of time you can charge upto 30percent by this you can see how fast it get charged and it stays long enough. 4/5In my experience im felt very happy with OnePlus THANKS FOR SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT WITH MID RANGE.Personal Rating :- 4.7/5"
427,Preeti,So far its good,5.0,15,8,2021,1,0,Good device in this price range with very good camera n smooth experience n display is brilliant. Only negative things i found are1. Battery life is so so not that bad though but not that good either. Only positive thing is phone is charged fully in half an hour2. Netflix is not in HDR though phone supports that. I hope further updates solve this issue soon
428,Nafees Hussain,Amazing phone with clean OS,4.0,10,9,2021,1,1,Camera and Multimedia setup is just wow in the device it clicks awsome pics and u can enjoy multimedia with its stereo speakers gives u enough sound to enjoy and a very special mention to its 50 MP Sony sensor which clicks really good images in low light.coming to its low point is its battery backup as it can give u a day full of charge in minimal usage but if you a gamer than you might have to charge ur phone twice but this issue can be covered by its capability to charge ur phone in just 30 minutes by its warp charge technology overall a good purchase for 30k
429,umesh p,"Worst product, Heating & lagging issue with basic use",1.0,11,10,2021,1,1,"I lost my hard earned money for this worst product. Earlier iam a realme 2 pro user, with lot of hopes i purchased this premium phone. But my realme 2 pro is far better than this.1) Heating issue with very moderated use2) phone lagging3) battery draining issue4) front came exposure is worst.Out of all, the heating issue is i couldn't accept from oneplus.Please anyone suggest better solution to get rid"
430,Siddharth,Great phone with glitchy software - iPhone users planning a switch pls read this,2.0,6,9,2021,1,0,"Bought this phone (12 GB RAM, 256 GB ROM, Android version 11, Oxygen OS) a month back, switching from an iPhone 6S. Here is some honest feedback after using it for a month. Especially for iPhone users planning to switch to it, think before you leap:𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘀1. The best feature of the phone is its super fast charging. It goes from 0 to 100% in 35 mins. I doubt too many other phones even come close. I ignore all else just due to this.1. The best feature of the phone is its super fast charging. It goes from 0 to 100% in 35 mins. I doubt too many other phones even come close. I ignore all else just due to this.2. The performance is good (as it ought to be with a 12 GB RAM), and works fine with multiple apps open. But honestly, I received the same kind of performance even with my iPhone 6S, bought in Oct 2015, which is mindblowing.𝗜𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗲𝘀 - 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 - Not sure if these are Android issues or Oneplus flavour related1. Notifications: This is one of the major problems in the software - notifications just pop up and vanish on the switched off lockscreen, even if you try to click them.A) All apps download with notifications on by defaultB) You can't just click on a notification while it is on the lockscreen and open it. You have to click twice for some strange reason and then unlockC) If you are using your phone like a business phone, you have an app like Outlook on it. So even the Calendar notifications disappear, which is a major issue - there is no option to ""snooze"" it or ""dismiss"" it. You have to just remember that this sound means calendar notification and then go to Calendar app2. Face and Finger unlock - Face unlock is moody. Even though I have set it up for auto unlock, often it doesnt unlock and I have to use the finger unlock. Finger unlock is great but has a 5 to 10% failure rate, but only if you havent placed your finger in the perfect position.3. Calls: While a call is going on (while using a bluetooth device), the screen goes dark after some time, and if you hit the power button (because you need to access some other app) the call gets cut off. I realised this is a setting, changed it. The issue is still there though.4. Switching from iPhone to Android - real life nightmare. The Cloning software on the OnePlus is of no use. Only your contacts can be smoothly transitioned by making a vcf file from iCloud and uploading to your gmail account. Not so easy for iPhone calendar - better to switch all calendar entries to Outlook, and then open them on the Outlook calendar on the new phone. Forget about whatsapp messages transfer. There is no free app for this, I used a paid app from Wondershare, worked well, but lost all my broadcast groups. Ditto for sms messages, only paid apps available, I didnt even try.5. Screen brightness - the screen brightness auto adjusts to a low setting, even if you dont want it, and even if it isnt needed. Extremely annoying.6. Battery: The first few days, the battery lasted a whole day after charging. However, after a month of heavy usage, I think I am seeing a slight deterioration in battery life, and I need to charge in the evening once.7. Google assistant - inconsistent, not as smooth as Siri.8. Dictionary shortcuts - I used them in iPhone, such as tbr for Thanks and best regards. But on this phone, I have set them up, but after one or two days they stopped working for some strange reason, and still not working.9. Photo gallery app doesnt even have a facility to add Favourites.Whew, these are the ones I could recall. Net, net, I would strongly recommend that iPhone users stay with iPhone and ditto for Android. The change is extremely stressful, and the stress doesnt reduce much with time."
431,chaitanya,PERFECT MID-RANGER !!,4.0,1,9,2021,1,1,"Great phone in the segment... using it since a month now ...camera quality is the flagship level here and dimensity 1200 AI processor plays a great role in gaming and other day to day jobs....yes, i must say i m not fully satisfied with battery life as it is slighly on the lower side, which is bearable enough...now speaking about the speakers, u would jst enjoy playing game and listening music.... VERDICT:- IF U ARE SEEKING GOOD QUALITY PHONE IN THE PRICE RANGE...GO FOR IT BECAUSE OF ITS CAMERA AND PROCESSOR AND SPEAKING ABOUT THE BATTERY PERFORMANCE THE 65 WATTS CHARGER WILL FILL THE GAP CREATED."
432,Sajith Geetraj,One plus is not One plus Anymore. Unhappy with the OS experience. Otherwise a good purchase.,3.0,11,8,2021,1,1,"I am a big fan of stock android experience. I previously had One plus 6 with Oxygen OS that had near stock experience.  Specs and everything is really good in this phone. For someone who doesn't care about the UI/UX, its a great phone. But for me its disappointing to see One plus merging the ColorOS and Oxygen OS. Until now I used to bracket One plus in the Google Pixel basket. With this purchase, it just moved to Mi, Oppo, Vivo basket, the basket that has phones with UI that tries too much and fails or are buggy. I was a loyal one plus customer, but my next phone won't be one plus."
433,Amazon Customer,This is not worthy,3.0,31,8,2021,1,2,"It's normal phone don't think that anything more this 25k is more for this mobile.Camera mentioned as 50 mp but picture is like 16 mp , battery is not tall good u need to have power bank if you purchase this mobile.Better you can purchase other brand this is my honest review"
434,Naeem Shaikh,Worth for Money,5.0,4,1,2022,1,1,"Fantastic product, i have bought this phone and using it almost from last 20 days and no issues found..each and every thing is perfect..the amount is justified with the phone..greate camera specially in video recording you will get the blur effect wich will make the object more brighter and clear..looks very nice in hand..battery is sufficient for a whole day used and it will charge in 33 minutes from 0 to 100%. Overall good phone..i will highly recommend this as compare to other phone in this price segment.. i hope my eeview will help to choose a good professional and budget phone..Thanks"
435,Shivam Goutam,Heating issue,2.0,2,8,2021,1,2,Heating issue is there and it's too much and lagg is also there but totally disappointed with heat issue want replacement of the phone I will suggest to wait for buying phone now..or go for good phone under 30k
436,Anit Kumar,Good mobile in This price range,4.0,7,2,2022,1,1,"Overall experience is fine but I found few drawback in this mobile.1. Proximity sensor is not as effective, it create malfunction even when slightly displaced from you ear. (compared to my previus vivo mobile)2. Finger print sensor also not much effective, It takes time to grant access or sometimes I have to put my finger several times to unlock.3. OnePlus has not given an in-built music player, i suppose it must be provided in every mobile."
437,Abhishek Javvaji,"Lag Issues and slow, my phone is just 4days old..",5.0,1,10,2021,1,1,"Everything is good charging, battery life camera, and performance... I've just played one game of pubg in my mobile, after 30minutes my phone starts lagging continuously....I was waiting and saved my money to buy this phone, I'm totally dissatisfied with one plus nord2 phone.....I really wasted my money on this product....Such a bad experience using in just four days...One Plus it's so bad from you...Not expected this from you...My phone lagged like 4gb ram mobile while playing PUBG...Then what's the difference between one plus and other budget smartphones...I never recommend anyone"
438,Saurav Anuraj,Powerful primary camera,4.0,1,8,2021,1,3,Primary 50mp is super. Best low light camera in this segment but ultra wide and selfie is comprised. Missing 4K in ultra wide.
439,Gunjan singh,Waste of money,3.0,28,7,2021,1,4,Disappointed.....The camera quality is not up to the mark.The display quality and colour are too bad.The product price is too high but the quality is too bad.
440,SRINIVAS G,Not as good as Oneplus premium phones,2.0,28,11,2021,1,0,"Earlier i used Oneplus 3T, this Nord2 is not even fast as my old aged 3t.  I never saw laaging in my old phone. This nord is not that much worth of 35K.  May be due to change in their processor to Mediatek. Sometimes the phone doesnt displaythe caller number/name when receiving a call and u cant attend the call.Further, due to default google calls and msgs u cant send contacts as sms and u cant record calls without knowing the other person that the call is being recorded (this might be there with other oneplus phones also, i dont know).Edit after 2 months usage :: Very slow while opening gallery, apps etc., When u delete group of files, images u will see its lag.(may be due to a different processor)  This phone is just comparable with a 10 k phone. Touch is not as smooth as flagship phone. Overall i am not satisfied with this phone for a 35k budget."
441,PRASANTH KP,It is an average phone,3.0,3,11,2021,1,0,"My first experience with One Plus brand. Nort worth for money, battery charge drain fast, camera quality is pathetic bellow average image quality. After few days of use showing some problem with speaker some times down side speaker work some times not. I feel like it is the same quality of some 15 k brand phones. One plus over priced for a this cheap mobile only because of their brand value. Only advantage of  this phone is very light and fast charging. Overall it is not worth to buy for 29999 ruppes."
442,vinay,Heat issue ... (Absolutely  - if your using the device in room temperature),4.0,21,10,2021,1,1,If you are get the phone at 25000/- ... Value for money and charging + all round performance for daily life usage + regular functionable camera + optimization + display + design and built-quality are the best factorsCons ….. heat issue after 1hr bgmi gaming + in this range the camera 📷 features or regular equal to the Nord CE + hanging issues + mix of color os is worst move + control the power the of 1200 Diamond chip and provide minimum usage capability.Hope small issue will be clear by coming software updates...... Requesting plz bring 90hz in bgmi too 😄
443,JITHIN A.,Nord 2 explodes again,1.0,12,9,2021,1,3,Oneplus nord 2 is in the news again as one more phone explodes in India.. I bought it last month. I requesting to oneplus replace with any other model..
444,krishna,Inconsistent camera and battery  drain  too fast,3.0,30,8,2021,1,1,Camera performance is inconsistent... battery  drains too fast.. heating issue while charging.. not happy with the 65 watt charger.. they could have given less watt charger but battery performance  could have been increased ... with this availability  issue  I have bought  this blue haze color which is not at all looking good...Display  is superb..Charging time is very less..
445,DebS,"Great phone overall, need few fixes though",5.0,26,8,2021,1,0,"The phone is good, switched from Pixel 2, so the experience is not that clean, but overall its not bad. Recommended for normal day to day usage, for gamers I believe better options are available.There are goods and bads, good main camera, okayish ultrawide and selfie cam (I don't use them much anyway). GCam does good job with selfie cam insted.There are few software bugs (feeling like beta version of Android which I used to get on Pixel devices) which are quite annoying and I am hoping it would be fixed soon.One is issue with Bluetooth earphone for prolonged calls, there is some jitter during calls only.. music works absolutely fine.Also while taking on Bluetooth, sceen keeps turning on sometimes even when phone is not touched (probably proximity sensor is still working) which should not be the case.Didn't like the launcher much, I reverted to Microsoft launcher which is clean and really good, almost as good as Pixel launcher with additional features.Battery I would say is enough for a day even with lot of calls, around 30-40 min gaming, 3-4 hr browsing or music I get at least 30% remaining (SOT-5 hrs, calls 2-3 hrs). I do use 60Hz screen though, but I guess even with 90 Hz charging or once would be sufficient."
446,Shibangsh Chowdhury,"Good phone, with a few drawbacks",4.0,28,7,2021,1,0,"Writing this review after 48 hours of usage.This is my first One Plus device and after using it extensively for 48 hours, here are my observations:The Good:- Premium feel in hand! Feels just like a flagship device. I have the Grey Sierra version.- Stunning screen and amazing haptic feedback gives you a great experience - I guess this is especially true for new One Plus users like me.- No bloatware, smooth OS with some amazing eye catching design and animations.- The rear camera takes some amazing pictures- especially in amole natural lightning and even night mode.- The dual speakers provide a good sound experience- 65W charger is stunning! From 25% to 90% in just 18 minutes!The bad:- The front camera is worthless - especially when you are using it against light. It takes VGA quality picture in this kind of setting- Battery drains very fast - even when phone is in an idle state with single SIM operation. Dealbraker.- While updating, Chinese text is displayed on the screen.- No earphone jackI believe that these issues can be solved with an OTA update. Will update this review as and when that happens."

448,Siddharth,Better than Mi11x,5.0,17,9,2021,1,0,"It's a near to perfect phone if you use it like 90% of the people would use on daily basis. 90hz display is just a cherry on top. Charges extremely quickly and lasts more than a day even if you use it more than your normal usage on day to day basis. Camera quality could be better but i have no complains as it does the job fairly well compared to it's competitors. It's better than Mi11x if anyone's looking for that, so just go for it."

But finally I made my decision to go with Nord 2 and went ahead, I am happy with my decision. It is worth the money. Till date Nord 2 received 4 software updates this shows the quality of the brand in resolving issues consistently.Battery life: decent, does the workCharging: super fast, no need of second thought, best inthe segment.Performance: Mtk 1200Ai (Flagship processor from Mtk), it is butter smooth, gives you a flagship experience undoubtedly.Fingerprint: above average, it is fast as per standards, bit doesn't detect sometimes.There are minor software which are getting resoved with each updateSoftware: One of the best in android.Camera: best in the segment.Overall great deal and perfect product from OnePlus in 2021."

453,Vikas Chauhan,Heating issue. My mobile reached 47 C when Playing BGMI. Also it heats on charging.,1.0,11,8,2021,1,1,Heating issue. My mobile reached 47 C when Playing BGMI. Also it heats on charging. I can not roam around carring a china made live bomb as while rebooting the text comes in china language. Even the camera when using on 5x 10 X ZOOM THE IMAGE quality is very poor. Noisy and blur images. The only thing good in camera is night mode which is not often used. I would suggest to buy one plus mobile from store and not online as the seller Darshita electronic provided the replacement for my nord 2 but the packaging was so poor that it seem to me that the box has been already openend and is then delivered to me
454,priyesh rathod,Best phone for long run because of clean OS,4.0,25,8,2021,1,1,If you want a phone which should not lag in future after few updates then you should go for this phone. Other phones also come with dimensity 1200 chip but this one comes with clean os which improves your performance. Last but not the least its body... nowadays even 30k phone comes with plastic body.. this one looks premium than any other phone in this price range.. Good work one plus... I am not a fan of one plus phones.. but i liked this one.
455,Addy,2-3 day impression (launch dat bought),5.0,29,7,2021,1,0,"Just to let anyone know looking to buy this this phone is not a gaming phone and so by default it run in balanced profile (new feature implemented by OnePlus for nord 2 only)still all apps and medium games run without a problem like premium but for heavy gaming you need ro enable high performance mode from settings (one plus usually does not do this different profile thing so people miss on this)but this increases battery consumption and heats the phone a lot so i will not recommend it , you can play cod or pubg at med-high  without fps drop but for ultra high settings or games like genshin impact (if 60 fps enabled) or fortnite you will need to use performance to play them on deceny to high graphic .The camera is probably one of the best at the price eith the best night mode at this range , it did have the overprocesing hrd but there was an update on the second day which did tune it down somewhat but without HRD everything is still good.Everything else is good as expected (good speaker , no bloatware,etc)"
456,Tushar Nerkar,Average phone with good camera,4.0,29,7,2021,1,0,"Pro1. Camera is good2. Heptic feedback good3. No heating issue while playing games like bgmi and no heating while charging4. Charging was very quick5. Speaker are loud and clearCons1. Fingerprint scanner is disappointed me I was using OnePlus 6 where I was having hardware fingerprint scanner which was way faster and accurate.  For on screen scanner I have to wake up screen first then scanner works2. No led light for charging on or off which was there in OnePlus63. Sms are not categorised all sms comes without category, in OnePlus 6 otp and other transactional SMS was coming very user friendly way4. Battery is draining faster optimisation required5. Dual app is not working( clone app)6. Without warning phone restarted and started the update which is surprising7. No 3.5 mm jack8. Provided back cover looks like very average design improvement required9. Plastic body"
457,Mujeeb,Missing the Essence of OnePlus,3.0,29,8,2021,1,1,"Brought this phone by exchanging my OnePlus 6. I feel OnePlus 6 far better than this phone..it got compromised with lot of features what OnePlus 6 and it's series has.. Biggest issue with this phone is Heating problem, it's feel like you are holding a warm iron brick even for normal usage, with the recent update heating is somewhat reduced.  camera is average.. Battery Back-up is average but you can charge it very quickly. New OnePlus users may satisfied with this phone but OnePlus fans gets disappointed..It's missing the essence OnePlus quality and uniqueness."
458,Jeeva,Don't buy this phone if you are already using one plus,3.0,8,8,2021,1,1,"I am using one plus 6 since 2019.I really enjoyed OnePlus 6 with the great and intuitive oxygen OS. with the same impression I have recently purchased one plus Nord 2 5G, but I am disappointed with the fresh oxygen OS which is pretty much similar to Realme OS/Oppo OS and GUI is not at all ok.One plus team please don't change the OS.Camera is better than its previous generation phone and battery life is  also considerably improved"
459,Himanshu J.,Good performer!,4.0,21,11,2021,1,0,"Nord 2 has a nice feel in your hands. In my opinion, the weight is a pro here. OS is very good. Screen quality, speaker are admirable.Now, i am a tad disappointed with the camera. And I compare it with my old 3T! Light is not captured to the best. Low light pictures struggle for clarity. Selfie cam is good enough. Having said that, still the camera is not that bad."
460,Ujjawal Rai,"Dont buy it ,. Genuine review fter using 3 days",1.0,1,8,2021,1,1,"Camera quality is like 13 mp camera. No clarity  in shots.

462,Sagar S,Best One Plus phone in 2021 (as of Aug),5.0,17,9,2021,1,0,"Best OnePlus phone launched in 2021 (till mid year). Much better than one plus 9R which has below average cameras. Nord 2 camera is on par, with much loved one plus 7 series (good).A true 5G phone with 5-6 bands. While the processor is mediatech, it is their flagship version and phone works great, with no heating issues. Refresh rate of 90 Hz is a balanced choice, as it does not strain the battery. Go for it, instead of spending 10-30k more on other 2021 one plus versions (till Aug 2021)."
463,Nikhil Singh,Overall good but found issues with Camera app,3.0,23,8,2021,1,2,"Overall phone is good but found few software issues with the camera app.Sometimes the camera app fails to load. Have to restart the phone to get the camera app working. Tried clearing the data of camera and force stop but app still fails to load.Also, found few random photos that got clicked with 648x864 resolution and the camera info is also missing in the photos."
464,Yugesh Nandakumar,Amazing phone for casual gamers!,4.0,11,8,2021,1,0,"The phone is great in almost every aspect. The nightmode in the phone is really good which is pretty nice, thanks to that primary sensor but the ultrawide is meh, Samsung's A52 is better, the battery life is good and fast charging is great. Only problem I noticed is that the phone heats up a lot sometimes, specially when gaming, but it doesn't affect performance, just that I don't feel comfortable while gaming for more than half an hour. Also the battery heats up a bit more than it should when charging which makes me a feel bit scary after that *news* 🙊. So I switched to a 33 watt redmi charger and the charging speed is still very good and also the battery doesn't heat up even slightly. Also I really wish they kept the headphone jack.My conclusion is that its a great overall phone which has the basics done right with a great primary camera and smooth OS (yes there's the colorOS integration but I personally don't mind it, frankly colorOS is also a great OS in terms of customisation) but if ur a gamer and wanna play every game at the higher graphics better go for the Poco F3 GT or the realme x7 max if u don't like miui."
465,Raviraj Parihar,A great midrange phone with spec and performance close to flagship,5.0,30,7,2021,1,0,Pros:Build quality is premiumSoftware experience even after color os merger is clean and bloatware freeCamera performance is great and it takes good picsBattery efficiency is really good and warp charge is one of the best in businessCons:Missing out of the box notification ledHints of color os in the software3.5mm jack missingStill overall a great package considering other available options. If you are into gaming you  may want to go for a SD processor otherwise this fit rite for most of the people.
466,Rahul Saxena,Battery draining very fast,3.0,11,8,2021,1,4,"Battery draining very fast, usually I have to charge it two times in a day even after normal uses. I don't play any games."
467,Deb,Amezing product. Go for it.,4.0,7,8,2021,1,0,"Recived my nodr2 today. Bellow some points to mark before you buy.1.Modification required in software department.2. Bugs in some apps. Need immediate support from OnePlus team.3. Clone aap is not working.i.e given dual sim but not dual aap to use such as dual watsaap,fb, telegram etc.4. Front camera is not upto mark. But rest others is excellent.5. Excellent Network reception.6. Charging Mobile Battery with 65 watt charger is fast as farari.7.Phone speeker is loud .8. Can watch HD content on OTT platform is buttery smooth.9.Hasslefree gaming experience.10. Overall 8/10 . Hope a better software updation very soon from team OnePlus."
468,GoShan,Good Mid range phone,4.0,17,9,2021,1,0,"A decade ago a flagship and later a flagship killer used to cost the same as Nord 2. With flagship phones now at 1 lakh plus, Mid range seekers like me are hunting in the sub 40 k to look good deals.From the word go, I liked One+ getting back to its roots of providing a phone with good specs at an affordable price range. The camera performance has never been a strong point but this phone's camera does a pretty decent job. One thing that stands out is the stellar battery charging speed, 30 minutes to full charge from 10%.The mediatek processor might be a new territory, but over the years, they have given some decent chipsets to compete with SD in mid range space.If you are not looking for pure performance but want an all rounder in the mid range, I will recommend this over the others available in the market right now."
469,Shiv dhakad,Superb phone,5.0,13,9,2021,1,3,Superb phone premium look all features are very goodBut Amazon was cheat my charger was missing at the delivery time and tell me after complaint no responsibility of Amazon. Service was wrost for Amazon.
470,Jasna satheesh,Value for money. Price to performance ratio is also excellent.,5.0,1,8,2021,1,1,"Fingerprint reader and cameras are excellent. Battery life is a bit low as compared to the competitors but the 65 watt charging compensates for that( i.e, 0-100% in just 30 minutes) . I was not able to find Carrier aggregation (eg :4G+) in this device but in all other aspects including the oxygen+color OS is a perfect combination which I personally like as all the cool camera features(Bokeh flare) of oppo phones can be found in this device. I personally like those features. No headphone jack but it's ok as every single company is following 'the apple way'."

Only issues i have discovered so far after using it for a week is that the screen glitches. Whenever I open amazon music, I can see certain lines appearing on my screen and they disappear again... also I was kind of expectating more options for personalization of my display or phone in all. The front camera is good... I hope the screen glitches will be fixed after the next update."

But due to fast charging, you can bare it.2. Display should be 120hz. It still good3. Price is high. It should cheaper 4-5 k"
477,jacob thomas,Worst phone ever used,1.0,14,12,2021,1,0,"This is my genuine review. Phone is useless. I bought it on 30 th November. Major issues are I have to get out of my home for getting a clear voice because all the calls are blurred coz of low network capturing ability. I used all my previous phones without any issue and network support is strong here.Secondly whenever we hold the phone to answer any calls and keeps near our face, it either gets hold , on loud speaker or on mute. Low quality sensor.Battery is a major problem. Even though it charges fast , it drains out too in fast mode. With my minimal usage I have to charge phone two or two and a half times a day.About amazon- I have raised they complaints b4 my return period and till now no one turned back for inspection. Inspection dates keeps on getting postponed.Better to avoid this one. I used One plus 3T, One plus 7 and One plus watch. I have never faced any issues with those products.But this is very cheap quality one"
478,Krishan,Beast from one plus,5.0,14,8,2021,1,0,"One of the balanced phone made by One plus .This phone is good for those people who are moderate user. New oxygen os 11.3 looks refine and bugs free.There is no issue like display flickering and app clone , crashing application in my unit .This device is heated little bit in normal use  but temperature is not greater than 36-38° C .This issue can be easily solved by one plus in future updates .Battery back up is good . I am getting 6-7 hour screen time in heavy usage.Charging speed is super mind blowing , getting full charge in just 35-40 mins.Camera quality is awesome.Verdict- If you want a balanced phone & brand name then go for one plus nord 2 otherwise there is more good mobile like realme x7 max , real me gt offer same specification at cheap price"
479,Aniketh S P,A balanced phone,4.0,11,9,2021,1,1,This doesn't have any distinct features for its price but it checks all the right boxes. I would have loved if I got a more brighter 120hz screen. I miss my good old headphone jack.Camera is good but not the ultrawide sensor.Career aggregation for 4g+ is working.I didn't find any bugs in this version of Oxygen Os (they got solved in updates).Final talk: I still feel I paid more for this device compared to competition.

484,Srideep dutta,Truly a flagship Killer!!,5.0,22,8,2021,1,0,"Truly after years One plus has returned with its flagship Killer title. I'll be baised and tell few points I noted while using it-*Beautiful design*Screen is amoled and it's 90hz but it could have been 120 but yes battery would have drianed faster so 90 hz is okay for me.*Excellent ram management with 12 gb ram I get 8 gb free which is really good. OxygenOS has really been optimised even though the code has been implemented with colorOS*Most amazing Primary camera, the sony imx766 sensor is truly an amazing masterpiece daylight and night time photos are flagship level. Ultra wide could have been 16mp as it is kinda okayish with 8 mp lacks details. And 2mp useless camera. Says it maintains Bokeh to be honest just to give a 3 camera it's included. You will be satisfied with the main camera only won't need anything else. Selfie 32 mp is also a sony imx 615 sensor does good job both in day an night conditions but sometimes in critical conditions of lighting lacks details.*Dimensity 1200 AI truly mediatek has got into the market with it. Antutu scores beat most flagship Snapdragon processors it's truly powerfull and snappy to use no lag on day to day tasks and gaming is perfect in this. BGMI max all settings 45 FPS avg. Smooth extreme 60 fps. Excellent job but realme x7 max has same processor which gives smooth 90fps option. Maybe an update while bring it so.*No heating issues whatsoever, using it for gaming and all other stuff for hours and also photography still temp seems not exceed 45 degrees.*Battery efficient?? There has been rumours battery is draining fast. I would like to suggest all every phone will drain fast even 5000mah battery ones too if all the sensors all the extra features all kinds of unnecessary things are turned on. You have to keep few disabled and necessary things enabled and it will and it has been lasting for me for one day (check YouTube for Nord 2 battery saving tips and tricks) and with its wrap charge 30 mins full charge which is crazy fast.*No audio jack, alert slider is there (saved) dual speakers, support for HDR±, 6 5G bands (thank you OnePlus for not giving 2 bands) both sides gorilla glass 5 and pretty much everything you could ask for."
485,Manik,Heating issue seems common across,1.0,8,8,2021,1,2,"I have been using one plus 6 and that processor still beats up meditek 1200 very easily..Heats up easily.. Even small applications make it hot.. Think about heavy applications, that may make it burst easily. Experienced after replacing 2wice the same handset. Quite a disappointment from one plus."
486,Karthik,It's an Average Product,3.0,22,9,2021,1,0,"Overall it is an Average mobile I can say. Because I have seen many flaws which keeps on irritating me everytime.1.  Most of the apps crashes without any reason and if I reopen it , again crashes. I have cleared the cache and done all other stuff which I found in internet but no use.2.  Screecasting is the worst one, if I do screen cast my mobile will be unresponsive.  I need to switch of my TV to make it responsive.3. Battery Back up - Though it has warp charge which charges in 20 mins from 5-100% . It discharges quickly like how it charged quickly.The best part of this mobile is Camera I can say. It is too good !"
487,Atul Movaliya,Blast of Battery News and UI  and Bugs,1.0,9,10,2021,1,1,"Got Scared about Blast of Battery News and One plus didn't reply them.UI and Bugs, Need and Solid Update.Don't buy until one-plus team officially make statement about blast and return or refund all the customer who bought nord 2"
488,Amazon Customer,Overall nice phone,4.0,4,9,2021,1,1,OnePlus Nord 2 is overall great phone. I will only point out the problems -1) Battery drain or overall battery is giving less working hours.2) Fast charging will not work if u r doing any thing while charging.3) Display can be improved one.4) Sometimes there are different lags coming which are fixed on regular basis.  I was searching for phone from last one year and lastly I bought this phone. Happy with phone performance with little much issues.

491,Akriti,Do not buy!!,1.0,13,11,2021,1,1,There are already a lot of reviews praising the phone. Definitely there are some good features like camera and fast charging but the negative aspects are more significant.The phone hangs a lot...even without too many apps or storage availability. It hangs every time you do a video call on whatsapp or keeps lagging even while watching videos on youtube. The lagging problem persists even while scrolling through the screen or icons. In clear words..it's very frustrating. Feels like I wasted my money.

   Video calls automatically drops on Google Duo ,get freezed on whatsapp and same with other apps . The Green notification light for camera turns off that time means the camera stops functioning .Twice i visited service center but the issue still persist now they are not ready replace my device and just calling me to service center again and again , my time and money got WASTED.DON'T GO FOR THIS DEVICEthis is full of bugs .Checkout the video ....i focused on the same object and you can see in the small scree it freezes after few seconds and then the call drops."
493,Sarvagya Gulati,Well worth the money spent,5.0,15,11,2021,1,1,"Pros: screen, connectivity (both Wi-Fi and cellular), charging speed, looks (except the blue one), gaming performance,The main camera with OIS is great but when combined with the the other cameras the overall camera system is ok.Cons: battery life is a little less than expectedAlso there is news about this phone exploding ....so for now I leave it far away when I go to sleep😑😑"
494,NIMISH,Average Battery and Camera,4.0,14,8,2021,1,0,"Below average battery and camera performance, OnePlus is getting inconsistent with it's quality control. Really like the smoothness and processor but doesn't matter if I have to carry the big charger everywhere with me. 2hours of navigation everyday sucks up the juice like anything, battery performance is bad and that's a big issue for me. Even visited the service center and they say they can't do anything the device is fine. Slightly disappointed from the standards of OnePlus"
495,Amit,This is not good phone,3.0,2,8,2021,1,2,As this phone is much costly compare in market. Still I have purchased it on behalf of OnePlus but I'm disappointed like not good camera quality even 50mp just like 12mp even front camera is good and about battery also average. And main problems is heating the mobile.  Personally I would suggest don't buy this phone
496,Venky,Phone - need  changes,3.0,26,11,2021,1,0,"Cons :1) camera lens are right side  and your index fingure will be on it while holding the phone.2) OS is color OS of Oppo,3) some of the button function very hard to operate4) the phone is size is big and weightProns:1) camera quality is good2) battery life and charging very fast3) Phone Performance is goodWhat big draw back is camera position on the handset."

499,Rakesh R.,Display quality and camera quality,3.0,27,12,2021,1,1,Honest review after switching from OnePlus 6 to Nord 2 5g.Camera: not upto OnePlus 6 which is launched 4 years before. Night mode is better but primary camera is not good. Front camera is good and better than one plus 6Display. Colour saturation is not good as OnePlus 6. Videos watching experience is not good as other mobiles. Colors are little dimmer that OnePlus 6 and other same range mobiles.Battery : good.Overall quality 3 /5Performance : 4/5
500,Amazon Customer,Super hyped average phone,2.0,12,8,2021,1,2,Felt let down by the phone.  Battery life is average. Selfie just makes me look RED. Photos don't look natural.  Super hyped average phone. Don't buy without trying at a store.  Buggy phone.  It always feels hot.  Never felt so sad about buying a one +
501,Krishi,Don't buy it,1.0,11,11,2021,1,1,So it has been 4 days I have received this product nd I would surely recommend u nt to buy this phone bcz it's battery is draining really fast like 100 percent charging doesn't even stay 24 hrs. And when I complained Abt it one person visited checked in it's app be told that battery life is healthy jst on the basis of the app but doesn't see tht battery is nt lasting even 24 hrs . After spending this much rs if we r nt getting proper phone then it's of no use. I will surely never buy anything from Amazon.

505,Raghu Bohra,worst purchase ever,1.0,13,12,2021,1,1,"This product is worst. Only buy it if you want to throw your money and do not want any return. After 1 week of usage it started to shut off automatically and continues to do so. After giving it to service center i got it after 25 days and still no change was done by the service center. Now I am again giving it to service center for repair. Please do not buy this, go for any other phone but not this one, trust me you'll regret it."
506,Yash Singhvi,The device is flagship in the budget.... Though you don't get headphone jack.... 😔,5.0,30,7,2021,1,0,"The device is an allrounder, it ticks all the boxes like :-1) the design is just the best it is premium in touch and feel and attractive as well.2) the cameras are breath of fresh air as it comes with a best in range actual 50mp main camera and above average to good ultrawide camera. In the video you get OIS some oppo features like Bokeh video, dual video mode, Bokeh flare, etc.3) performance is good, first time the company has used a mediatek chipset hence it is not yet fully optimised but it will get it in a month.4) the battery life is also good or say great, lasts a complete day and some more in the next day and as it comes with 65W charging it needs just half an hour to go from 0 -100%.5) the software is still oxygen os but withe few twists the camera app is from OPPO now the settings is redesigned to look more cleaner and more reale ui-ish but still nothing to complain about, except it is forcing in 1-2 features to agree with the t&c and privacy policy.6) the haptics are flagship grade speakers are stereo and are accurate mic is also providing good output.7)  RIP HEADPHONE JACK!! 🤯😱😔🥺🤣"
507,Dheerendra Sisodia,Ultimate beast,5.0,7,2,2022,1,0,I am writing this review after 4 month of usagePros-1. Best camera-good picture quality2. Beast processor-not hanged single time till now3. Warp charging-full charge in 25 to 30 min.4. Oxygen OS - have so many features to optimise your phone in best possible way5. Display- Amoled is good but could be more better but refresh rate make it butter smooth6. Stereo speaker - provides crispy sound with good bass and volume7. Build quality - premiumCons-1. Battery life could be much better- but can manage 24 hr. Or more By power saving mode2. Screen size - I personally felt that screen should be slightly bigger in this price range3. Heating- slightly heating issue while chargingVerdict- Overall phone beats all its competitors in this price range....Must buy 🥰
508,Avi,Perfect midranger.... BUT!!!!,4.0,4,11,2021,1,0,"I have been reviewing this phone for about a month or so. Was in a dilemma whether to buy this or moto edge 20 and in the end I decided to go for nord 2. So here is my review so I can help confused buyers ( I was at one point of time)The camera is awesome, oxygen+color os is smooth, the haptics is amazing, the size of the phone is perfect and concise. Your mind will be blown away by the 65 warp charger and this justifies for the 4500 mah battery that is provided.The only issue that I faced was.... Guys this isn't a gaming phone. I repeat this isn't a gaming phone (atleast for me). I played MLBB and after 20 mins into the game the device starts heating up and it goes upto 39-40 degrees and after that the touch becomes unresponsive or the game hangs... It's either of the two. This wasn't the case with my prev phone note 8 pro powered by a mediatek processor.For normal use if you want to purchase then go for it guys....its amazing. But for gaming I wouldn't suggest this phone. Will still be reviewing and will tell u more about the gaming issue."
509,Sunil singh,Please read it,1.0,17,11,2021,1,2,OnePlus making fool's day by day yes if you wana purchase this please make sure you will definitely feel that that you didn't make the right the choice becoz in every parameters its just worst experience like its camera bad as bad like redmi and its hang make us feel to sad worst phone of Oneplus
510,Rahat,Worth android phone from every aspects,5.0,20,8,2021,1,0,"It's been almost 10 days using this phone and I upgraded from Huawei but felt no regret. OnePlus was always been a step back in camera department but 1+ fulfilled it with this phone. If I talk about why you should buy this phone so there are many reason like if I talk about processor, display (won't feel slow if you comes from 60hz or even 90hz), battery, charging, camera performance, build quality and compaction; Nord 2 plays well.Things that makes a better user experience:Its premium hapticsIts Oxygen OS (coded with color os but still not a deal breaker)Its well optimised 90hz displayIts premium in hand feelIts smoothnessIts bunch of featuresIf you're paying little extra as per Dimensity 1200 so what you're getting an overall pack and its flagship feels then it's worth paying. Go undoubtedly, won't get regretted that's for sure.I hope, it helps you guys to make decision better for your precious bucks."
511,Buyer,Worth It !,5.0,3,8,2021,1,1,"1. The best thing about this product is it's Front camera and back camera. I switched from my 7t to this phone and camera is certainly an upgrade for me.2. Fingerprint sensor is just amazing.3. Go fot It, the product is super awesome and worth it under 30k for your D2D Usage.4. Battery Life is amazing on normal' usage works a day for me, nothing to worry about they have backed us with 65w charger 40% in 15 mins.Go for it guys !"

I thought of let's try Android. The way Iphone gives me the feel of speed , This phone also giving me much more. 3GHz speed is awesome. I jz started liking this phone and battery backup is awesome, I was fed-up with iPhone battery, This is much relaxing and 30min full charge it's pretty awesome 😎. Guys Go for it. 👌👍"
514,manthan j.,I think make more capacity battery 🔋..,3.0,11,8,2021,1,1,Fingerprint reader is normally work normal Speed but had face reading unlocked system is very greater than expected... thanks to one Plus to this..May I know one Plus atlis built-in 5500 MAH battery for long life...but why Not do this one Plus for a lite weight..? Thats not good for this range Phones....Main camera sensor is outstanding workings no word to describe this ..But fair quality in ultra wide camera or selfie camera...I think give update for this camera update...

516,Manoj Kumar,Could have been better,4.0,29,7,2021,1,1,Overall a good phone. Camera needs improvement as the color in the snaps seem over saturated. May be the future updates will improve the camera performance. No issues with mobile data network and wifi reception/speed.
517,Anand Kumar,"Misleading customers, of its built quality for sure",1.0,26,10,2021,1,2,"A drop of the phone from a height of approximately 3 feet has shattered the front glass both on top and bottom. I wornder if the is any kind of protetive glass as the company claims. Will have to look into a leagal/official way,how to get this claim officially verified."
518,Amazon Customer,Overall good phone,4.0,11,8,2021,1,0,"Phone is good enough with nice camera and fast charger.I don't find any heating issues or any other lag like crashing of apps, may be due to limited usage of phone without much of high end games.No issues with connectivity and phone looks premium.But still I feel it should costs around 25k not much as you have other phones with same features are around 20 to 25k.Just if you exclude 5g as still it will take few years to have 5g to can't comment on that.Overall phone is good, but could have with less price comparing to other same range phones"
519,Digvijay Rathore,Worst camera as compared to any phone under 15K,1.0,24,8,2021,1,0,"I was excited about getting a OnePlus phone for clicking amazing pictures, But as it turns out OnePlus Nord 2 is actually a Oppo phone with packaging done by OnePlus.The camera is seriously a huge disappointment. I am currently using Mi-A3 phone which costs 12K and it has a much better camera.Totally disappointed with this stupid gimmic played by OnePlus. Selling oppo phone was not atall ethical."
520,PAVULURI VENKATESH,Best in One plus Nord series till now,4.0,19,10,2021,1,0,"The product one plus Nord 2 is decent I would say. Past from 3 months I'm using this device, the major pros are1. Call quality2. Dual speakers3. Back camera4. Clean UI and interface5. Regular software updates.6. Battery life is decent7. Looks premium in hand8. Alert slider is there.Let's move to the cons :1. Front camera is not up to the mark (even my MI note 5pro is giving better selfie experience)2. No 3.5mm head phone jack.3. Few bugs related to software (hope it will be resolved in further updates)4. Initially while booting the phone, I felt warmth near the back camera portion. Eventually I got settled after sometime.Verdict : it's a very good device so far in oneplus Nord series. I felt happy if they might have provided earphones within the box especially in this price range. Justified the name flagship even though it got huge competition while releasing this product."
521,Gaurav kumar,Average phone in 30K not the best,3.0,13,9,2021,1,1,"It's a sub standard phone as compared to previous one plus phone experience. The software is not smooth and have heating issues. I am not happy with this phone. Display is good, Sound is Ok, and typing is good, Battery is decent, Front camera is below average and rear camera is good in daylight and night both. UI is good. The phone is not responsive enough.  Only take it of you want a brand value phone. I was not expecting this from OnePlus."
522,Nagaraj,Phone heats up quite often.. did a mistake of switching from one plus 6,1.0,14,11,2021,1,0,Nord 2 battery is 4500 mah but in half day it used to drain. Also as many people faced phone blasting issue. I was really happy with one plus 6 mobile no issues with it. I made a decision to switch only because it was 3 and half years old.. new one plus phones not even worth of it.. so sold my nord 2 and bought iPhone 12 during Amazon Diwali offer

528,Kantanu,A bit higher price as it(Nord series) will receive only one major OS update,4.0,25,8,2021,1,0,"As per the recent communication by OnePlus, it(Nord series) will receive only one major OS update. So, if you are expecting a phone with major updates for the next 2-3 years, this is not that one, keep that in mind. Also about the price point, it is a bit higher, if we are not supposed to get major OS updates. Anyways one plus will start giving discounts after 3-4 months.1. Speaker sound quality - 5 star.2. Battery charging - 5 star.3. Battery discharging - 3 star4. Screen quality - 4 star5. Call quality - 5 starMissing:1. Notification LED2. 3.5mm jack(won't be missed much due to wireless earbuds)3.

   The OnePlus Nord 2 is Best in Camera and Design!!Camera Quality!This Camera Really Excited me everytime.Dynamic Range is Very Good even in direct Sun light it's worls very well.And I like Night Mode it's gives usable pictures.The Main 50Mp Camera is Stunning in performance.Battery!Really the Battery performance is Good in this. Everyone is told this is bad but for 4500ah this is very good up to max 8hrs give backup.And Excellent in Charging. Mind-blowing with in 35mins it's full charged.🔥I am only Disappointed with Mild heat near the camera side for the first day and later 1 week use it's good not more heat at all. and 4k video recording is not up to the quality. It's look sharp in Phone but not in 4k monitor.Overall this is Perfect!!!  This is my first OnePlus mobile Best in Camera and Design."
531,Amazon Customer,Good phone and a very bad quality display,3.0,14,9,2021,1,0,"Display quality is poor and when looking directly on a white page some parts of the screen are warm and some are cool. On slight tilting shows rainbow colours on a white page.This ruins the whole experience. Nobody is talking about this in reviews here or on YouTube. Thought maybe my unit is having issues, but my friends nord 2 has the same issue, while searching on internet I found that many of the nord CE users have also complained about the bad display with exact same issue, and recently one of my friends who has the nord 1, I found the same issue. So I think the whole Nord line-up is cursed by the bad display.Looks like OnePlus doesn't care about its users and about their feedback. And worst part is you cannot return because of Amazon's return policy."
532,Murthy,Excellent Phone.,4.0,2,9,2021,1,1,The overall review of the phone is excellent. But it also does have some pros and cons in which pros win with majority features but the cons are that with phone doesn't have an IP rating and it's quite the dark spot of OnePlus because in India we don't know when it rains or when we'll accidently drop it in water so that's the end with of cons and the rest come below the pros table. Hope OnePlus will add an IP rating in the lineup of their future phones.
533,shravan,Unacceptable cost cuttings,1.0,25,9,2021,1,1,"Touch sampling rate is lower than mid range phones at 120 hz and you notice it while using it.. they used low quality display, it has low brightness than nord 1 and CE. We can not find these things as they dont mention it anywhere and we expect good display and touch experience at this price point. They purposefully lowered the performance of the chipset, this phone scores lower benchmark than any other phone with same SOC- DC1200."

Screen refresh is so smooth.Rear camera is unbeatable but front camera is disappointing as it is marked 32mp.A little bit heat during charging but after charge it cools down very fast and no heating issue during operation.I've my rate as 4.8 out of 5."
537,SATYA,Budget android phone at higher price,2.0,6,12,2021,1,0,"Oneplus Nord 2 5G . Sleek body sturdy body with a premium feel is a good android(Oxygen OS) based phone to opt for a relaxed use.But as per the Reviewer hype it is not upto the mark . At 28-32K price range it is just ok kind of phone to opt for . In comparison to One plus Nord2 5G only one phone that is available Google Pixel 4a(which is not launched in India,also have only service centre). In that aspect Nord2 is better choice . Unless being an open mind you can opt for Oneplus nord 2 5G,Google pixel 4a , iPhone SE."

If you forget that it does not have a latest Snapdragon chip in it (does not make a difference to experience), you will just love the phone.Probably, the camera maybe slighly not up to the One Plus 9 Pro mark but is still better than One Plus previous series like 8. The selfie camera is even better than One Plus 9 phone.65 watt charging is just amazing - 29 minutes to full charge.. no more worrying about battery.."

The best you can get at this price range, display could've been 120hz, but 90hz will work smooth as well. The camera is as expected, a solid one. The battery life amazingly surprised me! It easily gives you on screen 8-9 hours. The performance is marvelous! Overall the best ever phone I ever used."

545,Shivani T.,Good purchase but not every phone is a perfect phone,4.0,29,8,2021,1,1,"Phone is very good but I will only tell you the cons which I feel could have made the phone better.1. No headphone jack even connector not included in the box.2 No earphone mode(settings) as available in all other oneplus phones.3. Battery backup is for a day or max 36 hours in any case, you use the phone or you just keep the phone.4 I have never been a fan of OnePlus camera and again the situation is same.5 Fingerprint scanner is on display."
546,Amazon Customer,Better alternatives are available,3.0,1,8,2021,1,1,"I received the phone in 4 days the phone looks and feels superb. Display is good but not bright enough for outdoor usage. Performance wise, the phone lags at times. Camera is good and fingerprint scanner is feels a bit slow if you are switching from phone with physical fingerprint scanner phone. I heard a lot about oxygen os but this one broke all my expectations, software is buggy. Battery backup is OK and 65w charger does very good job."
547,Arpon Mohajan,The video hunts for focus..,3.0,11,11,2021,1,0,The product's main attraction is its camera. The camera is average. Don't expect much. Also the video mode always hunts to focus even in between video making the video look very bad. Also the camera cuts the sides and crops the image in both camera and Video. The wide angle lense and the monochrome lense is a waste bin. Only good thing about this phone is its fast charging and sound quality
548,HEMANTH NAIDU,Just go for it bruh,5.0,1,9,2021,1,1,"It is smooth and looks amazing ,haven't found a single issue till now, 5 star is not justified but neither 4 star , 4.5 is my score 120hz could have made this a champ ut honestly speaking it doesn't matter,games like pubg,Asphalt are running without a single frame drop, don't listen to people who defaming OnePlus,they did full justification to OnePlus nord 2 ,just excpet 120hz ,buy it mahn you won't regret"
549,Amazon Customer,Good but could be better,4.0,11,11,2021,1,0,"If you are the guy who have never purchased any oneplus phone and thinking that nord 2 would be the first one to buy then this review is for you:Display: (4.5/5) Really good display with punchy colours but i would mention that for some of ott platform videos it could have been better.Camera: (5/5) Best camera module i have seen as compared to samsung good mid-range phones also.Performance: (4.5/5) Top notch with buttery smooth gaming performance. There were minor shutter lag which i have noticed but it can be ignored.Battery: (4.5/5) you should know that oneplus phones are know to give a good backup even if the battery is <5%, so summing that up you get good performance with good backup which will last you 20 hr for moderate to heavy usage.Haptics and feel: (5/5) it's the best and i can say you will feel that you are using flagship level phone.All together i can say that if you are oneplus fan and planning to buy a phone in mid-range price bracket, you should definitely go for it."
550,Darshan A S,First Phone at good value in all aspect,5.0,8,8,2021,1,1,"I purchased blue haze variant of  Nord 2 5G. My first phone at high price range and seriously happy with this product purchase. When i saw reviews about the heating, really reviewed many other brands with this and finally gone to this because of one plus features and name. Initially, it warm ups because of the all software updates and other process took place simultaneously. Later i didn't find any warm/heating till now.Really Worth to invest on this phone."
551,Sreekanth M,An average product with high cost,3.0,30,8,2021,1,1,"I'm writing this review after a month of use , the product is ok however it's overpriced for the specific range with average features. Camera is just ok but not much perfect and looks sometimes animated or over beautified. Battery life is perfect and an average product for high cost !"
552,Amazon Customer,Pathetic disgusting and this company sucks,1.0,20,11,2021,1,1,A big NO to Oneplus. Their purpose is just to sell phones and after sales service is zero. It’s been more than a month I’ve given my new phone for repair and there is no response from them. Such a disgusting and pathetic company. If you want harassment in life please go for it. Never never never never never never never never recommend it to anyone. Please please please please avoid buying any product from Oneplus. A big NO.
553,narendra singh,Best mobile in this range gives flagship experience,5.0,29,7,2021,1,0,"It's been 3 days since I am using it,it's amazingAmoled screen gives u flagship experienceSpeakers are as good as a tv or music system speakersCamera gives super clarityBattery backup is amazing it runs 24 hrs without any need of charging,I used for YouTube,browsing,music etc65 w warp charger is simply superb within 15 min it charges 50% which is enough for 1 day,30 mins it takes for 100% chargingWe can't get this much quick charger in any other mobile in this rangeOnly small issue I faced is while closing the open apps,the bottom button has to be slided which sometimes don't respond, which I think we can learn over period of time. One plus can look into some simpler way for itOverall superb phone go for it,I migrated from iPhone 6s still liking this one"
554,Srivardana,Amazing phone,5.0,22,10,2021,1,1,Very nice phone. If u are looking to buy a phone with a budget of 30000 you can definitely consider this one. The smooth screen makes the scrolling so much fun and the camera quality is pretty much great. The performance is also good and u can play games without any frame drops. The battery life is average but the 65Watt fast charging covers it up pretty awesome and charges the phone to around 90 percent in just 20 mins. The battery lasts a full day on moderate usage.
555,Rohit S,Beast mode performance in descent looks.,4.0,14,9,2021,1,0,"Model: 12GB RAM, 256 GB Storage.Camera: Excellent Night mode (see details in Living room Image clicked when hardly any object in room is visible). Wonderful color corrections by AI. Image quality is amazing & colors capured are extremely close to visual scene.Storage: Faster read and write speed.CPU & GPU: Minor glitch while playing 4K video on YouTube. Gaming performance is wonderful.Fingerprint sensor: Sometimes, False positives are there for non-registered fingers with similar fingerprint pattern. Strict matching is required here.Face Unlock: It is very quick.Heptics: Wonderful experience of Haptic feedback.Screen: Vivid colors with wide viewing angle and 90Hz display seems ok for general use but for Arcade gaming its not up to the mark. Pixel density is just right for realistic image experience.Video Enhancement: It is wonderful features while you are video streaming on network data.Inbuilt Zen Mode feature: I would recommend this for every working professional.Review written after 35 days of Handset usage."
556,shyam,Good phone,5.0,3,8,2021,1,0,"Earlier I was using MIUI , so now oxygen OS feels like heaven.Below are my pros and cons in comparison with the phones of similar price range.Pros:1)looks2)fast charge(65w warp charges phone 100% in ~35 min)3)good rear camera4)lot of 5g bands(7)5)value for money6)good speakers7)dual 5g supporting sim card slotsCons:1)battery drains a bit faster as it has only 4500 mah capacity2)should have give 120hz refresh rate, but 90hz is decent enough3)absence of 3.5mm headphone jack4) non expandable storageOverall it's a very good oneplus phone for this price."
557,Arijit Ghoshal,Only if battery backup could have been better,4.0,1,8,2021,1,0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Over all good product.Only glitch is the seemingly poor battery backup. Yes the 67W warp charge adapter covers up for it(super duper fast charger), but still, with a Bluetooth headset connected and approx 1hour audio music streaming, battery drained real fast.Face unlock is funny though, it captures and unlocks the phone just if my face is in the vicinity of front camera. Not a deal breaker. Finger print scanner works fast. Camera is good. Low-light is good but looks artificial.Only if one plus had given 3yrs of OS update and 4 years of security patch update."
558,Vishwanath,Heating issue and rapid  battery drain,1.0,25,8,2021,1,1,"I have been a loyal customer to Samsung since 2011, I have changed 4 mobiles in this period, and all were Samsung,  this was the 1st time wherein I switched to ONE+, it's been 6 days my mobile started heating slowly even at idol condition, and the battery started to drain rapidly, such a worst experience buying oneplus,I regret completely switching my brand, I recommend not to buy this product , one plus haven't engineered this particular model properly,"
559,rashmi,Good purchase but few drawbacks,5.0,1,9,2021,1,2,The phone is good but big disappointment as for 30kNO IN BUILT FM RADIONO HANDSFREE OR EARPHONESI think there was a lot of hype about the phone. Camera and battery life is good.For music lovers  this phone is a big Noooooo
560,Amazon Customer,My first OnePlus phone,4.0,29,7,2021,1,1,Nice phoneI have purchased it on very first day sale with exchange offer. It cost me 25749 rupees .Pros: 1) phone looks are just awesome and in hand feel is decent .2) Music quality is quite decent with best in class dual sterio sound3) Charging is fast  it took 20 minute in charging from 30% to 99%4) Cemra look decent in indoor but it quality can be improve in outdoor5) Ui experience is quite smoth6) No issue while gamingCons :1) No HD content streaming on Amazon prime video2) Cemra is good but not decent as per price range
561,Mohammad Ibrahim Khan,Great purchase,5.0,20,9,2021,1,0,"The phone is flawless in every manner, except of a few small flaws which includesGlitchy microphone: it has a random low pitch and low resonance sound.People can hear themselves back while in video calls.Otherwise, its a great phone overall; great for gaming, and basically a near-flagship."
562,Shrishankar Madas,Worst worst after sale services,1.0,16,10,2021,1,2,"ZERO RATING, I am trying to fix the faulty charger that I received, customer support guy talks like a recorder!  Can't help need to visit Services centre To fix that is one and half hour Travel one side!  NO PICK AND DROP Facility!  DON""T BUY.!!!!1000% NOT BUY recommendation"
563,Snehil,Certainly not One Plus,3.0,10,8,2021,1,1,Look - goodQuality - OkPhone lags even after latest updates and 8GB RAMPoor network IC - you will face call disruption/ difficultiesFeel like average phone and certainly not the feel of One PlusBetter to settle with other good phone than One Plus in this price range. I am not very happy with the overall performance.
564,Shahrukh Shaikh,Not justified the brand value,1.0,20,8,2021,1,1,"I have been using this phone for 1 month but apart from camera nothing works well. Touch response and refresh rate is pathetic, this will never give you the premium phone feeling.Not justified to its brand value and price range.Go for other phone in this price range."
565,Lone Suhail,Compromise in almost ever thing.,3.0,8,9,2021,1,1,"Using this device from the last 15 days.Missing 120hz display, no stereo speakers, fingerprint sensor not fast, camera not that much satisfactory. I think I have to compromise in a lot of major things.This device has dimensity 1200AI and 3.0GHZ primary clock speed, but couldn't feel that high performance during gaming or any process. Gets heat up in normal usage sometimes and the battery still drains (looks like this device contains about 3000mah battery)"
566,Suraj,Fast charge is awesome,4.0,2,9,2021,1,0,"I bought this mobile in august 2021, am giving this review after using this mobile for 20 days. Actually this is my first one plus mobile. camera clarity is nice, audio quality is good, battery life is good, fast charge is awesome. within half an hour you will get full charge from 30 percent charge. But slow motion camera not upto the point. It is good to use guys"
567,Nagarjuna Raya,"Don't take,lot of problems are there",1.0,9,8,2021,1,2,"Face detection not working, music App not there, compusary buy a new earbuds, battery fastly drain. My humble request plan anyone plz don't prefer this mobile."
568,Shubhs,Camera needs improvement. Rest is awesome.,5.0,7,11,2021,1,0,"The phone is gorgeous I must say. The look and feel is really good. Screen is nice and bright. Sound is way more louder than I expected. Heptics are good too. Camera is perfect for night and videos but in daylight it needs improvement. You can play games in ultra graphics. You won't notice the difference in refresh rate in a week, you have to use a 60hz phone. Battery is insane in terms of charging speed. Man it goes from 5 to 80% just like that!!Summary - Go for it if you want no nonse phone and you do occasional photos."
569,Aakash Yadav,Value of money,5.0,28,12,2021,1,0,Awesome phone in this price as it had rapid charging adaptor (warp charge) that charges your device in minutes and had 4500 mah battery which is sufficient in amoled display .Sound quality is also awesome .It is compatible with gaming but best for those who use it as a camera phone
570,Nitesh Kumar Kashaudhan,Not recommended - dissapointed,1.0,9,10,2021,1,0,"Lots of bugs, Lags and apps support is not great. Camers stops in between. 1ST TIME ONEPLUS TRIED BUT DISAPPOINEDTED.Software needs to be polished by oneplus only provisfing good hardware is not what we expct at this price.I wish I can go for samsung next time as thier software is good and bug free."
571,Sukhvinder Singh,Finger is not scant before a click to display atleast one time.,3.0,13,9,2021,1,0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Good Ponts:-1. Batterty life is great and fast charging also great.2.  Camer is better performance in night mode, I impressed. but not a good work some time in normal photo in sunlight.3. Display quality is so great and gives a better experience during watching movies.Bad Points: -1. Big problem is that the fingering scanner is not work smoothly on Ambient display than scanning on wake display.2. Finger should scan directly, but its need at least one click before the finger scan on Ambient display.3. Diplay brightness is poor in sunlight. Other phones is better preform under 20,000 INR.4. Vibrator is poor than other phones.5. Sound quality is good only when see the movies and poor when listening music.(A Little problem  is facing during incoming call, is that when I receive a call while doing any task, its open on whole display, then I go the home Butten and go the same task again. then the call going in back ground, so I can do my task again."
572,Someone,Good phone under 30K,4.0,20,1,2022,1,0,"I purchased it with No cost EMI on Amazon Pay - ICICI bank credit card (first time)Please note1. There is Rs 200 extra processing fees hidden and will be charged on your statement. Issue is when I called bank they told Amazon will take care and when I called Amazon bank is charging.2. GST is charged both on Principal & Interest . This amount is not included in the upfront Interest discount that you get from AmazonPhone:.Camera and battery is superbLongevity (max 1.5 years), as its getting hanged after the first update.Ads will popup sometimes in notification , i guess I have to turn it off. See review and unboxing on YouTube before purchasing"
573,Nizhanth,Best Midranger I guess.,4.0,3,9,2021,1,1,"Since this is my 1st phone above 15k,i had to choose very carefully the mobile i am going to use for the next 3 years & i am seeing the signs that i picked the right one. Pros :- •Gorgeous Design•Excellent stereo speakers.•Good Cameras.•Pretty Clean UI.•Speedy Fast Charging.Some minor issues. •Heats like hell while charging (Both Brick and Phone) •Asks Too many permissions for many apps. I don't consider the abscence of Headphone jack and SD card storage as a thing as it's common in this price segment. Overall, I'm loving it without any regrets."
574,Reena,Worst phones!!,1.0,3,8,2021,1,2,I was nt expecting  this kind of phone from oneplus 😞since first day..iam facing issue no applications  working within seconds it get close getting error internal storage full 😳I have 8 gb ram 256 versionPlease refund my money i dont want this pathetic  phoneAmzon dont sell this phone u will loose your good customers
575,Sahil Sharma,Sheer waste of hard earned money,1.0,7,10,2021,1,0,It has been one month since I purchased this mobile. However my worst dream has come true. I purchased this mobile with 12 GB ram so that I may not face any lag issue in normal day to day operations. However to my surprise it is just impossible to use phone now. The usage is very much similar to unfer 10K samsung phone which takes huse time in responding to apps and any command feed to it.I have lodged complaint to CEO of One plus China nd Inda along with Twitter complaint and NCH complaint. I am very very disappointed with the performance of this mobile.It's a strong suggestion to ignore this purchase and opt for any other brand.
576,akash jana,Overall good phone,4.0,24,12,2021,1,1,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I was concerned about blast issue but I took the risk and get the reward. Yes it's not perfect, it doesn't has 120hz display, just 8mp wide angle sensor, slowly loosing its oxygen os charm but it has a good quality stereo speaker, good haptics, latest sony sensor camera with ois and also fast charging. Overall satisfied with this device. Someone who is looking for overall good phone I highly recommend this device."
577,Firdaus Ahmad,Initially i liked it but some concerns are there.,2.0,30,7,2021,1,0,The phone has an option to snooze the alarm  by power or volume key but it doesn't work even with an update. Alarm keeps on ringing unless you go to the alarm app and turn it off there.I found another issue that is the call recording. The other person easily gets to know that you are recording it. Because the phone says loudly that the call is being recorded. To overcome the problem i tried installation of many call recording apps but even after giving all permissions no app worked properly. During call the other persons voice isn't being recorded. I am getting a feel that i got a wrong choice in changing from samsung to OnePlus.One more issue i found is with video calls the apps like google duo whatsapp suddenly loooses access to camera and also the screen shuts off while video calling on duo. Direct video call is hardly conected.This is not a good product to choose. Better to go for other brands like samsung and realme those a cheaper and better than this.
578,Ankit Singh,Almost the best thing in the smartphone segment.,5.0,28,11,2021,1,0,"So it's my first time using a OnePlus smartphone phone after I was impressed by their product 1+ 7T. Though the price is very less than it's flagship phone 1+ 9pro , it offers you the same rich amd premium feeling.1) Built quality- It's very impressive, you'll have a smile on your face (if you haven't invested more than 20k in a smartphone before) after you'll hold it. And for me, the looks really matter in any product, it has to be appealing and I'll have to say that I'm appealed to it sight.2) Display & Camera- Very crisp and detailed. The display gives you the feel of S20 series of the Samsung. We can say that they could've improved their camera but, what more we can expect in an entry level smartphone. Right?3) Audio- The stereo speakers are amazing, like mind blowing. There are two speakers in this phone so you don't need to resort to headphones if you're watching a movie alone. It almost gives the cinematic experience.4) Battery- I think this is the last part which needs some analysis before buying a smartphone. I'll have to say that the battery drains a little too fast or maybe it's because the battery capacity is 4500 mAh. But it charges very quick so.Bottomline, if you don't wanna spend too much in a smartphone, which is around 50k then go for this. Cuz even of you'll sell it later- you'll get a better resale value for this brand than it's competitors. Which is another big plus point. Rest I leave it to your wisdom to choose."
579,Tanmay B,Heating issues,5.0,30,7,2021,1,1,From every point of views of specs and performance of this phone is decent and balanced but yeah I am facing over heating issues soo OnePlus should watch towards..Front facing camera is also fails to white balanceOverall the look of this phone is awesome and 50 mp primary shooter too
580,Dilip Kumar Saha,Fluid experience,5.0,13,10,2021,1,0,"Review after 1 month......You know the pros like processor, camera, 90hz, etc etc.I was only experiencing less battery backup at initial time and huge battery drain at night.Solution: I am keeping my phone switched off at night. Also turning battery optimization for specific battery draining apps has helped. Now I get about 7 hr screen on time which is perhaps more than enough for an average user. Initially the phone took 40 min to charge fully. But now it charges completely within 30 min, as advertised.A little bit heating issue, but ""not overheating"". Keeps around 37 degree Celsius. Highest temperature I recorded was 41 degree( playing PES in max settings).The new update has also fixed battery drain issue.Overall my experience is superb, specially in such price segment.**{Don't compare it to poco de gt, that has only two 5g bands, no ois, and moreover MIUI.... Famous for bugs and lags. Literally I have experienced lag only once in this whole month of use}*Anyway, people may have their individual opinion. But since I am writing this review, so I have expressed my own opinion. Don't get hurt.Conclusion: Overall good. Nothing is perfect. But in comparison this may be your next budget-premium phone"

Only Pro I can think of this phone is fast charging, put for a charge, have a cup of coffee and charges to a good percentage.Been using Blackberry, iPhone and Samsung as I'm a Messaging Architect and Architect for Mobility in my company and clients..."
583,c sridhar,My second Nord,5.0,28,7,2021,1,2,Got it today.Phone looks premium.Seamless transfer of apps and contacts from my old phone were very smooth.No lag so far.Yet to test the camera.Got 1k extra on exchange.(5.4k in total for Moto Power One).Pleased with the transaction.
584,Yash Patil,Excellent Phone from One Plus after long time.,5.0,26,8,2021,1,0,Review after 1 month Heavy Usage.Pros/Cons:-1. Superb Camera Quality (Front).5/5Selfie camera is decent. 4 out of 5.2.Good Battery life and Phone charging speed also good.In 25 min you Phone charged around 80%.3. No lags while playing high graphics game.4. Speaker is clear and loud .5. Good display.It is oxygen and colour OS mix but you will se 95% is oxygen os except camera app and some settings.Cons:-1. Its not 120hz display2. Display should have more brighter.3. Should add metalic frame.4. Slow motion camera is not that great as compare to other OP.Result: Excellent mid range phone which takes superb photos and can handle all types of games.
585,robin singh,In the name of brand one+ it's a flop one.,1.0,30,10,2021,1,1,"Phone is below my expectation, heating too much even while talking, on videocall 2min is enough to feal the heat, if u like heat better go n buy a heater in cheap rate. Why waste 30k, only displays n touch givs good feal. In primary use phone's flop showI rejected this one."
586,Sooryakrishnan U,Worst phone I have ever purchased.,1.0,8,2,2022,1,0,"After buying the phone I tried to set up the phone by adding Google account , it ask us to restore the previous settings and I did, after 1 month if usage, amby issues statrted to arise ( Eg: 1. if you try to attach an item in Gmail after writing the body , the content automatically gets deleted. 2. if you try to upload any documents in the website, it says due to insufficient internal memory, process cannot be done.3. Now if you try to report these bugs using the logkit in one plus community, theere are different sections of phone categorized for each bug, this actually crash when tou try to touch on any of the icon.)Only way to reslove the issue was to format your phone, and i did it. Again Setup the account, this time I ddnr restore all the settings from Google , but did some of them as manual, and the phone started to work properly ( the above mentioned issues were not present now). 2 months after this , these issues are again started to come. If I need to format the phone every 2 months , how can a user buy a phone worth 30k and use peacefully.I feel cheated. Please don't buy"

588,Karan,One plus nord2 5g,4.0,29,7,2021,1,1,Seems like a true upgrade to one plus nord and the feel is different altogether. It will give you a premium feel.Pros:-1) Camera:- Straight outta one plus 9 pro2) Display:- Super Amoled3) Body and Design:- Top notchCons:-1) No 3mm Jack2) Netflix and prime not supported in HDR. Also you can't stretch upto full screen3) Lower refresh rate
589,Viraj Zambaulicar,Can't get better than this! Grab 1 rn,5.0,25,8,2021,1,0,"Absolutely no complaints!Getting regular updates to improve camera and every reported bugBest thing I liked is the personalization that comes with the OS inbuilt, rather than installing multiple other appsYes, certainly it needs some improvements but I think OnePlus will provide updates and correct all the problems. So yes, go grab one!"
590,kavin Gokul,Feel good phone for people coming from budget phones,4.0,8,8,2021,1,0,The phone is solid in terms of build quality. The battery back up from a full charge could have been better. The phone so far is fast and plays games like bgmi smoothly.The best part about the phone I feel is super fast charging abilities. Gets charged in a jiffy from 0-100.I don't understand why the heck nowadays companies don't give 3.5mm jack. It should be given.Another complaint I have is that battery drains pretty fast for a new phone I hope they fix this issue through ota.Overall a good phone with correct screen size and weight. Ideal for a normal person using for calls some videos on yt and some occasional gaming
591,Ronak,Budget friendly powerhouse smartphone,5.0,29,7,2021,1,2,Nord2 Looks like a pro smartphone and very very smooth and responsive touch with super fast wrap 65 charger everything works like heaven.But small lag in face recognition sometimes is not recognised my face hope Oneplus will solve this issue in the next update

Processor is also fast (have not found any lag while playing cod.) I will check vedio rendering speed and will update about it.Display quality is also nice , since I have earlier used OnePlus 6t, It is better than that display.Audio quality is awesome.Charging with 65 watt is something magical.

594,Pankaj Sharma,Value worth,5.0,1,9,2021,1,1,"I was very confused, while ordering this phone. As I was using Samsung S series phones previously. But honestly saying, I'm fully satisfied with this product. Good battery life. Good camera quality as I was expecting. And a decent look. Quite happy with this. I had ordered it on same day, when it was launched. Now I have used it more than a month. Fully satisfied."
595,Deepak,Nord 2 _ Awesome upgrade !,5.0,29,7,2021,1,1,"First impression - Really great and Worth the upgrade for 30k.I suggest don't go for 12GB variant.First thing I checked in the phone the 4G speed and carrier aggregation. It's really fast and able to get a max speed of 70+ Mbps using Airtel network.My previous phone were able to give only 40 max.Camera is nice . Worth for 30k.Even though it's 90Hz, you won't find any difference.Battery backup nice - I got around 9hrs of screen on time with average usage.Haptic feedback is really good.Display is awesome."
596,Amazon Customer,One of the best midrange smartphones available in 2021,4.0,6,10,2021,1,0,"Review after a month's use,1. Good design language at front and back. Oneplus could have given metal frame considering the price.2. Screen on time is average but given it's fast charging capability it is not an issue even for aggressive user.3. Camera quality is very good, in night mode is blows away other midrange smartphones.4. Processor is fast enough no lags and no heating issues. Has plenty of 5g bands..5. Good speaker quality. No headphone jack though.6. Software is bug free. But true oneplus fans will not like the small changes brought from OPPO's colourOS.7. Fingerprint is fast enough. Does not unlock with dust or water particles if present.8. Good display, outdoor brightness is average, only 90hz refresh rate.Final verdict,Very good midrange smartphone."

599,Karthi Subramanian,"Fastest Charging, but in the same way, it's getting discharged... !!",4.0,3,8,2021,1,0,"The overall feedback is ""Satisfactory"" only, but I have expected something more since it's from ""OnePlus"".Pros:1) Fast charging, approx 40mins to get 100%.2) Smooth display, screen enhancement with MediaTek 1200 AI worked well.3) Primary camera quality is awesome for this price segment.4) Ohh Yes, the new front camera sensor serves its purpose. it's much better than the former one.5) Overall phone performance is good.Cons:1) Fastest discharging, reduces to 20% with 4 to 5hrs (I'm a regular user, no gaming, no streaming more than an hour, additionally just turned on hotspot for my work)2) Wide angle camera is not good.3) If you have experienced the original OXYGEN OS already, Then the mix of oxygen OS and Colour OS surely will disappoint you."

601,Ravichandra Ginne,"Would have been excellent, if a few things were improved",4.0,26,9,2021,1,0,"This review is after using the phone for more than 2 months.I used other mobiles which have more premium processors and refresh rates. But,I love it more than all of those. The reasons are:1.This is such an excellent phone given its pricing and performance. It is buttery smooth when we consider the performance. No lags found anytime.2.Display quality is awesome. I felt 90Hz is the best among along refresh rates. Videos give the best experience on this phone.3.Fingerprint is fast.4.No annyoying ads or bloatware. Clean experience. This is really important for a stressless and smooth daily usage.5.UI is excellent. Easy to use.6.Connectivity is awesome.7.Call quality is good.8. Other features like NFC and multiple users etc are worth a mention.9. Games play very well. No lags at all.10. The best best thing about this phone is, its charging speed. It's ultra ultra fast. No phone can beat this in terms of charging. Just a 5 min of charge can help you complete all your urgent and important tasks.11. Protective case is the best quality and it saved me from phone drops multiple times. I suggest to use the one provided in the box as its of a very good quality.12. Overall the form factor is good, light weight and easy to carry and use.13. No heating issues at all.Cons:1. Battery performance is bad when connected to mobile data. Drains like anything. You need to charge it twice, if you access mobile data throughout the day. But, it's better on wifi.2. Back camera quality is bad even in good lighting conditions. It doesn't look like a 50MP one. Cant even perform any better than an average camera of phones under 20k. Under low light, very poor performance.3. Front camera is good in good lighting conditions. Again dissapoints in bad lighting conditions.4. Both cameras lacks in giving clear details and adds a lot of noise.Irrespective of Camera and battery issues I still consider this as a good value for money, performance for price phone.You can decide whether to purchase or not based on your requirements."
602,Venkatesh,One of the best Smartphones - writing this from One Plus Nord 2,5.0,20,9,2021,1,0,"Alright, this is my first ever written review on Amazon.This device is excellent, do not heed to the negative reviews seriously. All phones in this range will surely have heating issues when you use the device. It's called running a more powerful processor. The OS is decent enough, maybe perhaps the Color OS overtaking seems like your data will be stolen or monitored - but then again, which device doesn't do that? All phones access all of your information, anything with voice recognition and camera will surely access your data. Will it get leaked? Surely not, that's a whole another level of privacy issue. No company is willing to compromise your information for that stake, Google already collects your data as it is, and that's why your ads are as per your search histories.Use the device for what it claims to be, the camera is undoubtedly brilliant. Apart from that you can surely run Call of Duty Mobile and even PUBG with it heating up to 38°C and once you close the app it quickly reduces the temperature to stabilize around 33°C to 35°C based on casual usage.Yes, camera will surely warm up the phone - it's dedicating itself to continuously understand what you're doing. The AI for that is doing that job. But once you close the app after your usage, it's fine. Use OpenCamera from Play Store to test all of the resolutions if you want, it's good.Now coming to the actual UI, it's good - comfortable. Perhaps 120 Hz refresh rate should have been provided, but then again 90 Hz still seems smooth.You can use RAM Boost to keep the apps that you regularly use to launch faster, which is good.Battery life is mediocre, but the charger that you get is brilliant. It truly takes your phone from 20% to 100% in less than 20 minutes.If you think this device has heating issues, and you've heard of the news of the blast - think again, it's your choice. But if you want the device for what it claims to be, then you won't be disappointed.All in all, a satisfying purchase. Your money is definitely not going to the bin. Single comments or shortened reviews don't help your purchase, details are necessary since you rely on them for your purchases.Final verdict? Go ahead, purchase the phone. You will not be disappointed."
603,shah neel,Value for Money,4.0,30,7,2021,1,0,"Pros:Performance (10/10) : It is fast and I never felt any lag, I am not a gamer.Battery (10/10): I love the charging speed, you will see the magic in 25-30 minutes and the battery backup is good.Design (10/10) : It feels premium and build quality is good.Speakers (8/10) : crisp and clear voice. enough loudness.camera (7/10) : You will not get any out of the world experience but it takes good photos. You will get very good portrait photos and low light is also good but front camera is average. I have attached two photos. one from nord2 and one from moto g5s plus (4 years old) . of course, Nord 2 captures better details but I would not say huge improvement considering moto is 4 years old and still taking a decent photo from its 13MP camera.UI : UI is good, people are crying on youtube over color os,  do not take them seriously.Cons:No earphone Jack .Privacy issues : you have to give permission for lots of things but privacy on the internet is a myth. until now we were sending our data to US servers now it will also go to Chinese servers.The camera could have been better but can not complain for 30k.Most of the people are confused between nord 2 Vs mi 11x Vs Realme X7 Vs Poco F3 GT Vs IQ00 7I was also confused, I wanted a phone which I can use for at least 4 years and as I said I am not a gamer so I will not feel any performance difference. I was looking for future proof phone if you compare all the above devices nord2 has the highest number of 4G bands forget about 5G. Carrier aggregation is also good."
604,ADIL KHAN,Worst service,1.0,8,11,2021,1,0,"Hi Everyone,I Heard about ONEPLUS brand new phone i.e. one plus nord2 5G. I was so excited with the features 12GB RAM, 256GB memory and cost is only 35K. So I planned to purchase it. I ordered the phone on amazon and I received the phone on 1st September. After 3-4 days, I found the issue in the phone,The issue is ""When you call to someone, During the call, the network signal from both the SIM suddenly get disappeared and the call get breaks and after 10-15 seconds the network appears again. I have faced the same issue multiple times, when you call to someone and during important conversationwhen the call get break, The person on the other side also get irritated. I called one plus service centre, They said to troubleshoot the phone and guided me few steps that I have followed and still got the same issue so I called them again. They asked me to bring the phone on service centre or send it by courier for repairing. I thought courier service would take lot of time, So I preferred to go to the service centre which is 110km from my home. I planned a travel in the weekdays and go to the service centre. I am from Khandwa(M.P) and the service centre is in Indore. I reached the service centre after 5 hours of travel. They asked me to take backup of items in phone and comeback after 3-4 hours, When I went back they said the issue is resolved, I was so relaxed, After 10 hours of travel in a day, It was so hectic. Finally I reached home at 1:00 AM. Next day I called through my phone and the same problem happened again. It was so frustrating and I had no idea, What to do now, I again called the one plus customer care, while calling customer care also the call got break, I was not able to talk to them properly. It was so frustrating to call them again and again and complaining the same issue. One day I sent an email also to the Europe region and explained them everything then I got a call from Bangalore region from customer care centre. While I was talking to them also and trying to explain my problem the call got break and I was not able to make call back to the same customer care number. I Handle lot of my work through phone and the primaryfeature of any phone is calling, If it is not working then there is no use of phone. I requested to customer care multiple times to replace it, they said they can't do it,Then I sent my phone through courier service on 26 October 2021 and then called the customer care to get updates of my phone, they said the repairing is in process, it will get back to me soon.Today also I called, now they are saying they haven't looked out the phone yet due to multiple holidays, The customer care people giving different answers Now, I don’t have any option other than waiting for my phone. I REQUEST TO THE PEOPLE WHO READ THIS POST, YOU MAY ALSO SUFFER THE PROBLEM THAT I AM FACING. I know that it happens with 5% customer but you may come under 5% people.PLEASE BE AWARE OF USING ONEPLUS BRAND PHONE.Thank you for reading this post."
605,Aman Bhandekar,"Excellent Display, Camera and Speaker!",4.0,28,8,2021,1,0,"I received the phone 2 days after ordering. The package was in good condition.I have been using this phone for now 3 days. My experience till now is like -Camera - Go for it, excellent camera, 50MP main sensor is just wonderful. Videography is also superb. Thanks to colored oxygen os now we get oppo camera app and it has better features. Front camera is also good. Not that excellent but good!Display - You will love this display. Smooth and sharp, amoled display. 90hz just feel amazing. Colors are beautiful.Speakers - The main highlighting thing of this phone. Stereo speakers. Just amazing. The loudness is out of this world. Even at full volume the sound doesn't get distorted.Battery - 4500 mAh battery can get you run your phone from morning to night very easily. It is ok because they give you 65W charger and that is crazy fast. Just 30 min gone and your phone is fully charged.Fingerprint and FACE unlock - Fingerprint is OK. 9/10 times it recognises and is fast. Face unlock is blazing fast. You just look to camera and it gets unlock in mili seconds.Design - Looks premium in hand. It feels you are holding a 30k phone. Alert slider is there. I got the blue haze color which is really awesome. Overall excellent looking phone.Network - I am using Airtel sim and I got really good speed. Like about 1mbps to 2mbps downloading speed. 4G+ is not available in my area.Get this phone If you are planning to buy a 30k phone. You won't be disappointed. Don't go for that color os merging thing. It doesn't affect the oneplus experience. And if you are first time oneplus user you won't even notice that."
606,milan prajapati,Fantastic phone by OnePlus! Excellent,4.0,1,1,2022,1,0,"This is my first OnePlus phone. This is one day impression. What I like isDisplay: 5* best in 30kRear camera: 4* not a problem with rear camera it has everything what I need. Crystal clear,Selfie camera is okey okey, something like midrange oppo phonePerformance: 5 starWhat I miss , is sound quality in blootooth device very everage quality. OnePlus has to correct this by ota update even my redmi note 7 pro has good sound output."
607,Umair,Experience>specs,5.0,30,7,2021,1,0,"So there are better chipset mobile available in same price bracket, the value this phone creates is exceptional. The optimisation with Oxygen os is flawless buttery smooth, then the size is perfect coz I like to browse with one hand and it was perfect coz the width has been given due consideration.Now battery back up is a bit weak for heavy user but I charge for 15 mins and it's good to go.I was using latest iPhone max model couple of months back but that was too wide and I feel this phone's smoothness can be comparable to iOS, iOS winning just by minute differenceCamera is good but not great please don't compare with iPhones picture, but it is generally good, night mode is excellent.If you love android devices you cant go wrong with this phone, But if you are gamer I would suggest there are other option, this is like an overall package for a wider audience."
608,CHANDRU,Confused state of mind - now cleared with nordy,5.0,7,11,2021,1,0,"I m an mid range user recently bought this Nord in a little confused state after reading so many reviews finding that cons are more than pros , but I neglected everything and weighted upon myslef whether this Nord will work out for an normal user or not and finally bought this ..Note: I'm not an gamerMy geniue review after one week of usage1. Design -handy and slim, ll gives u a look of 50k mobile, sure it ll attract both u and others2.user interface - Simple and neat as I'm new to oxygen got admired . Some says it's colour os combined . But for an new user it won't be matter at all3. Camera & videos- Admiring... u ll be satisfied for ur money with this alone4.  Battery - Low capacity need to charge twice a day but withstand till night from day charging for normal call , browsing watsapp and facebook5. Fast charge - U ll get surprised definitely, 10 mins is sufficient for getting 50% so no.4 now won't be a matter at all for u ...Over all for mid ranger who are under 20k who want to get upgraded can go for this Nordy sure ll make u get premium look... Since I'm not a gamer I can't comment on that part ...Others  like low refresh rate of 90k , this colour & oxygen os merging , low battery capacity, no HDR+ in Netflix which were told as a cons - Hey guys these and all not even a matter for us don't mind about these things at all ....Regarding blast issue don't worry because each and every brand has its own blast ...."
609,Debadutta Das,Stereo speakers,4.0,30,7,2021,1,1,Overall the phone has a premier Look.battery charges really fast..However i find my speakers producing a zzzz noise  when the volume exeeds halfway.Its like something is blocking the sound and its not clean.Tried cleaning and restarting but its the same.I am not sure if its the issue with everyone or only me.However if the volume is lower than half which is also pretty Loud then i dont fine the speaker problem.
610,BOBY PATHAK,Good or Decent,3.0,21,8,2021,1,1,Phone is good in package but now motorola edge 20 announced and game changedThis Nord 2 need battery Improvement and midiatech chipset is also not goodAll at the end Nord 2 is Decent smartphone
611,Amazon Customer,Overall Good not Excellent!!! OnePlus could have made better !! !!!,4.0,18,8,2021,1,0,Purchased the phone on 1st sale. Writing this review after using the phone for 15days.1) Performance 10/10. No lag issues. I am not a gamer.2) Main camera 9/10.3) All other camera 6/10. They are average. Selfie lover should ignore this phone completely. They will get better device at this price range.4) Charging 10/10. Nailed it !!!5) User Interface 10/10. As it is my first onePlus phone so I am not aware what impact it had created after merging with colour OS. It is clean and I have not faced any problem.6) Dual speaker with amazing sound. 10/107) Headphone jack Missing. You are going to miss a lot if you are not used to it.Wish oneplus increases security updates from 3 to 4 years minimum like Samsung has done for its mid range devices and register this device under google Android enterprise program.
612,MD I.,Handset Designing Defect,4.0,14,9,2021,1,0,"Functionality wise and operationally the phone is good but it has a flaw in it's handset designing. The power button is just opposite to the volume button. While operating phone with one hand and trying to lock the screen using power button,you would accidentally push the volume less button together. It'll lead to capture a screenshot unwillingly. The volume button should have been put slightly towards top to avoid this."
613,Shriram,It's one of the best phone in the segment!!,5.0,19,8,2021,1,0,"This phone is the best in this segment. Firstly, to clarify against others reviews. My phone doesn't heatup, I don't face any lag issues, battery doesn't seem to drain and everything seems to be fine. if you guys are facing any of the above problems, probably you have received a defective product.1.Camera is good. Rear camera could have been better. Front camera is awesome.2. Display is really good. I don't personally see difference between 90Hz & 120Hz display.3. The phone doesn't heat. It gives out nominal heat any phone would radiate.4. Gaming seems to be smooth and you can play for one hour long and feel lil heat on phone.5. Battery seems to be great. I haven't faced any battery drain issues till now.6. Face unlock is pretty fast compared to other competitors.7. Dual speakers is loud but lacks the crispness in audio.Few things which could have been better:1. Rear Camera Software updates needed.2. UI seems to be a problem and few bugs are there. Can be updated in the future.3. Fingerprint sensor sometimes experience a lag. Updates could solve the problem."
614,Ak,Good phone with few Pros but many cons.,3.0,19,10,2021,1,1,"Pros: It looks good, camera quality is also good.Cons: It heats on normal usage.Battery life is also on lower side.Display refresh rate is just 90 hz (in this range almost all mobile comes with 120 hz)."
615,Jani Bhargav Kishorbhai,Lacking problem,2.0,31,8,2021,1,0,please don't go with Youtuber video reviews because..before some days i buy nord2 because every Youtuber says this is valuable but don't say this device with lacking problem..you are use your 5 to 10 app and suddenly you lock your device then some time after you are reopen and try to use your nord2 that time device slower ..then you are removed your all app to background then its working normally.that's problem i have face so i return my device
616,Chandu,"Starting mobile didn't turned on,Missing cable, touch screen not responding properly.",3.0,1,2,2022,1,0,"It took 2 days time for getting on the phone which didn't respond properly, received only adaptor and anyhow tried to manage with the other charges available with us in the home. And after the mobile got on. The charging was going down quickly without using any apps & the touch screen also not responding properly sometimes.Also didn't had a earphones jack to the, expected alot and purchased the One Plus mobile but got utterly disappointed with this.And to raise a complaint also matter didn't got sufficient in 1 column to explain the multiple issues so raised multiple queries.Don't know how and where it will take to the extent.Especially purchased this phone based on charge expectation only but in that 1st step only went wrong.I request the team to refund or replacement with a new device.Thanking you,"
617,Binay kumar shaw,All-rounder phone from OP,4.0,4,9,2021,1,0,"PROS--1. Screen Quality is very good and bright enough for usage.2. Finger print sensor is blazing fast and accurate.3. No bloatware smooth Software experience.4. Charging is very fast 25-30 minutes and completely charged.5. UI is very fast and responsive like APP loading RAM management is very good.6. Speakers are very loud and you will feel that stereo speakers.7. Back camera performance is very good.CONS--1. Battery drain is bit faster, drains about 5% in whole night when in standby with bedtime on.2. Front camera is average at this price point.3. Super battery saving mode should be included.VERDICT--Overall a good phone considering the price point and the devices available in the market at this price segment by other brands with Bloatware's in the UI."
618,harsh kumar,Perfoance is good but camera is bad,3.0,11,9,2021,1,2,"As seeing the news of explosion 3rd time, I think it's the wrong choice I made it this time to bought this mobile. As it is my first one plus mobile and getting this type of news make me feel like why I bought thus. Is there any to return this mobile and get back my money."

620,Ramkrishna,Battery and features are not but not upmost,3.0,31,7,2021,1,1,Though phone quality is good but I am not impressed with overall quality of Camera and other features.Same quality we get half price from other brands.Not received the color which I selected without any offer.
621,Ashutosh T,A perfect upgrade,5.0,1,10,2021,1,0,"The phone indeed feels very premium. The matte glass back is great. The display is crisp and has punchy colors. The Oxygen OS is smooth and clutter free. The cameras are a highlight point, low light performance is also great. The processor is butter smooth, very powerful. The battery life is good and has got insane charging speed, charges in less than 25 mins. Also no heating issue experienced. Can definitely go with this. Really loved the phone."
622,Ananthu,Best All-rounder,4.0,30,10,2021,1,0,"Have been using the phone from the last 20 days. The in hand feel is great and feels premium. Camera and sound is the area where the phone stands out. Images comes out to be a bit sharpened at times. This might be due to the image processing. Although 4 out of 5 times the images turns out to be great. Video output is exceptional.What feels like a bummer is the portrait mode and selfie camera. Another main Pro is the speaker. Trust me you won't have to turn it up more than 75 percent most of the times. Haptic feedback is good and doesn't feel cheap.Performance wise haven't come across any lags or hanging.As most of the reviews point out , I haven't had any issue with the battery backup. Most of the time it gives an SOT of 7 to 8 hrs in 90hz. Also the phone doesn't heat much as the other reviews suggest.The only con I noticed is with the software.Phone just shutdown randomly 2 times during this period of 20 days.So in short, if you are looking for a premium phone under 30k then this is the one to get."
623,Amazon Customer,"Battery, Notification Panel functionality, Battery and finger print scanner",2.0,6,8,2021,1,0,"After waiting and thinking a couple of year finaly I purchased my 1st OnePlus smartphone after knowing that the experience of OnePlus is smooth like butter and bloatfree.But I things were not so easy.1. I love replying any messages on social media or whatsapp by just going in Notification panel.But here in Nord 2 it's a nightmere for me.Replying to messages notification panel was pathetic.Multiple keywords never worked so far (p, q and caps keywords).2. Finger print:-Below average. Multiple times not working.3. Battery Backup:- Not good.Battery drains so so fast.Overall not happy.Mainly bcz of floating widow didn't worked and finger print scanner.Submitted complaint on OnePlus community and OnePlus support. Haven't received any solution.Amazon done a lot drama in replacement/return. And got nothing.Pathetic service from Amazon (in this project) and OnePlus.Cannot trust these 2 organizations now."
624,Jeevanandham Shanmugam,Great value for money!!,5.0,12,10,2021,1,0,I bought this for my sister and she really loves it. She is using it for few days now. She is extremely happy with the product. From appearance to performance everything is great. Looks very premium and stylish. Go for it if you are looking for a phone under 30k with 5G and performance.
625,Anoop C,Amazing Value for money,5.0,8,10,2021,1,0,"Best camera for this price.. I'm not a hardcore gamer, so can't comment on the gaming aspects.. for normal use and content consumption like Netflix and Amazon Prime it's a great phone.. it's super fast.. 65w charger is next level, will charge phone from 0 to 100% in 33 minutes.. with 7 hour screen on time I have about 25% battery remaining by EOD.. even though some color os has creeper in still it's clean.. no ads.. overall best phone for 30k.."

627,Sanchi B.,Camera !,4.0,8,11,2021,1,0,"Delivery was on time and very fast, got it 3 days after ordering.got the phone three days agothe old to new phone app transfer was smooth so didn't need to install all applications again.I was expecting a good camera but not really satisfied with it , even though it has 50 MP main with the other 2 rear ones. front camera filters the backside a little bit too.And the images taken in dark comes out dark as well.I just focused on the RAM and storage space. It lacks details in the photos and somehow it filters the photo for normal cam , like how oppo phones does.I want Raw images taken , haven't tried the RAW filter cam yet though.also, i did not check for audio jack before hand , but nord 2 does not have audio jack so make sure to notice that.I t is said that for this price it is really good in terms of storage and camera is average. even my old vivo phone of merely 10k gives better pictures in terms of details is concerned, so that is an ick for me."
628,Sudhanshu,"Don't buy this shit, now it is just a Chinese low quality cellphone",1.0,27,8,2021,1,0,"1. Battery is worse , you cannot keep on carrying a charger along with you if you are going outdoor for full-day, even at standby mode also battery keeps on draining, pathetic battery life.2. I odont know about other one plus phone as this is my first one, so I will say a proper 10000rs cellphone has a better front camera as compared to this one. Rear camera with 50mp is of low quality, you cannot get details of any pic if you zoom it after capturing. 2mp ultrawide camera is useless , low quality images.Worst thing is it's battery won't last for even half day, it's good that it has fast charger BUT who carries charger with them all day, atleast One Plus could have increased the battery capacity.One last thing, please STOP collaborating with OPPO to manufacture cellphones or else you will end up like Nokia in next two three years.All in all, this is the worst cellphone ever manufactured by One Plus. Even the side casing is of cheap quality plastic."

Regarding front cameras an update came early morning and that fixed a lot of issue still some issue with front facing.Cons why to buy:1. Camera is plus point2. Oxygen os is buttery smooth and the haptics my god just wow.3. Battery almost goes 6+ hours and charge only in 30 min lightning fast⚡4. Display is also too good and speakers are just wowwwww what a sound it provides btw earphone jack not there but you can use type c to 3.5 mm jack and it also provides a loud and bass boosted music5. And Looks are ♥️6. Wifi speed gives awesome and 4+ in my area from sim 17. I played pubg and asphalt 9 with max settings no heating issue no lags.Cons:1. Sim2 network is not good don't know the issue2.missed 3.5 mm jack not a big issue
631,Souvik,Best camera and great software experience,5.0,30,7,2021,1,1,Pros**Top notch quality phone by 1+ **Hardware and software experience is unavailable . normal using on 90Hz refresh rate I got 9h 21min screen on time.ConsMinor heating issue on heavy using means heavy heavy using otherwise no problem at all
632,Ramrajsinh,Flagship killer,4.0,30,7,2021,1,0,"First oneplus device for me. I was very eager to buy the oneplus phone and experience of the oxygen OS. I was realme 2 pro user and believe me it's huge upgrade in every aspects for me.1) No leg in daily usage. Display is very smooth. If you are thinking the 120hz display is better then 90hz, it's not. One can hardly notice the difference. So 90 hz would be not be a problem. Also it's 600 nits display, but it's very very bright enough.2) In every online platform I show the pictures of the phone and thought the bottom chin is big phone but when the phone in hand it's not like that big. It's acceptable. The bezels are also very small.3) The charging speed is very fast. It charges 0-100% in just 33-35 min. Phone can easily survive in whole day in rough usage. So battery backup would not be an issue.Edited: After using phone a week, I can say that the battery backup is not up to the mark. Based on 4500mah tag it should give  more then 1 day. But mostly I need to charge the phone twice a day. Very disappointed. Aslo some apps are getting crashed ocassionaly.4) The fingerprint scanner is working very well5) It not fills that heavy in hand, the thickness is also acceptable.6) One major experience is haptics in the phone. While typing and in any touch areas the experience is at next level like a flagship phone7) I have not tested the camera thoroughly but for now the camera seems pretty promising. I will update on this once take more photo samples.8) It's stereo speakers and it's very loud. Not distortion at max volume. Not like flagship leval phone but it's loud enough.Till date in hands on this phone it's very very good. I will highly recommend if you want to experience a clean oxygen OS. Instead of buying oneplus 9r/9, I would recommend to buy this one.Hope this will be helpful to choose wisely."
633,Siddarth,Premium phone with awesome camera,4.0,30,7,2021,1,0,"Phone looks and feels premium,Camera quality is amazing...Best phone for regular use,warp charging is game changer surprised to see phone getting charged with in 30 mins.... Don't know long term implications on battery due to this...But phone get stuck or goes unresponsive while playing games intermittently..Overall its a value for money phone....."
634,Human,Not as expected,3.0,31,7,2021,1,1,"Not found better than realme 7 that was exchanged, except for the  loudness not great quality. Screen not smooth-- for finger surfing. Takes time to load apps. Charging also not exactly as claimed. Even screen touch misses, once in a while. Stopped playing youtube video even when autoplay is on. Auto answered call without ring or vibrate. Hangs. Overlapping text when font/display size increased. Great looks though."
635,suman,Battery drains too fast,2.0,24,10,2021,1,0,"Mobile looks awesome and build quality is great. Fast charging and good camera.But the fingerprint reader is not upto the mark, it doesn't read my fingerprint properly sometimes.Battery drains too fast. Even if u keep it idle, battery drains automatically. I am not a gamer or don't use camera too much, still it's getting discharged on it's own.Also there is some heating issue. When you video call for more than 30mins, phone gets bit warm."
636,PRAVEEN,Over all good phone,4.0,29,7,2021,1,0,"I like nord 2, my first impressionFirst thanks to Amazon very fast delivery.1.Good looking phone2.OS good3.camera good4.sound good5.fast charging6.display finger print good1.display not super2. little bit heat issue3.i don't feel of 90hz refresh ratephone is good when we give to much expectations that's little bit disappoint...More 5g band support for long term use"
637,Tarun Kasera,"Apps throwing out , sound, fb - insta video stuck not performing well..worst phone don't buy it",1.0,5,9,2021,1,0,"Overall experience is very bad I am using it around a month and finally today I have to sell it by 25k only. Irritating me due performanc... Every time I have checked fb insta and other apps it's showing blank when we see reels video's.When we share any image it shows Bluetooth app 5 icons , fb 4 icons and other apps too multiple time ...Eeeeee too much irritating. And in this 30k price we are not expecting this worst phone from OnePlus.I have purchased 3 phone and every phone having same problems. When we use any app it suddenly stop and again we need open...it feels like oppo ,mi phone not expecting like OnePlus.When we try calling sudden hang and during using many times goes hang mode again need clear and start from scratch.Don't buy it's just wasting our money in this price we many nice option but I was go with OnePlus brand but it's totally worst....😭😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬"
638,Anil,"Heating issue, bugs and battery drains faster",3.0,11,8,2021,1,1,"Major issues:Phone heats up even during normal usage. Ex- 5 mins of what's app call phone temperature increased and you can feal the heat even on back cover.Battery backup is not good. Maximus you will get 6 hrs of backup with normal use.Oxygen has lot bugs, may be because of the merger of code base, those needs to be fixed.Overall not satisfied with the product."
639,Dilip Mayur,Nord 2 truly a value for money smartphone,5.0,4,10,2021,1,0,"It's been two days I amhave been I am using the phone, upgraded from Huawei P20lite and trust me loving the Nord2 every minute..I am normal user and feel this is perfect.. display is smooth @90Hz.. you can personalize notification and other settings.. camera quality is good..."
640,Sujay sarkar,Personal Review,4.0,27,10,2021,1,1,Got Nord 2 days ago after 2 days of uasage here is my review the phone is good in all stuff except if you don't open pro gaming mode and play games phone gets heated and battery drainage but it gets charged fast in 25-20min so not a problem...overall performance of phone is very good I have no complaint cos luckily I didn't get defective product. And I am not a hardcore phone user always so this phone fits for me.
641,gaurav tyagi,Beast in all categories!!!,4.0,30,7,2021,1,0,"Beast in all categories leaving other rivals far behind.Don't be confused on YT reviews on under 30K phones (Poco F3, Iqoo7, Mi11x, realme 7 max)All devices have similar display (Nord 2 is the compact and bright one)Camara is the best in the catsgaries (iqoo7 delivers similar experience)Performance on 1200 Demensitiy is well optmized (iqoo7 and 11x will deliver slitly better performance)Look -- ( best in the segment)Future ready -- it comes with maximum 5G band so it's good if you're planning to invest 30k for 3-4 years.(rest all gives 1-2 bands, only real me will give 7 bands)Overall a good phone ticks all catageries.4 ratings because of ColourOS merger, 1+ you will have to think on OS merger (still best UI)"
642,AʀᴊunSʀɛɛ,Fully Satisfied with the Phone,5.0,1,9,2021,1,0,"It is premium quality product from OnePlus unlike the other competitors in the same price range and I am fully satisfied with the performance and experience.Pros : Smooth UI and UX, Build Quality, Performance, Camera, Display, Battery Charging SpeedCons : 3.5 mm (but bluetooth 5.2 connectivity and quality is awesome), sometimes hearts (not much), storage is only 128 for 30kWriting review from my Nord 2 5g 8/128 GB ⚡⚡"
643,Saurabh Adlakha,Heating issue battery drain very fast don't buy,1.0,7,11,2021,1,0,"Really disappointed with phone as the price is extremely high 30k but quality wise it is very bad..Phones heat up like hell, battery drain in 4 hrs ... I bought this phone because of its market name but extremely sad as I lost my 30k with this cheap phone...I was really happy with my last phone Real me 3 pro but not from this one..I suggest don't buy this phones go for real me brand they are quit good as per the quality and camera..."
644,Amazon Customer,First time use oxygen os it is awesome.,4.0,6,8,2021,1,1,Every thing is superb.1 Camera 📷 excellent2 battery 🔋 good life for day to day users.3 battery charger is superb.4 display is superb. It is something different.5 process is awesome.I have used all OS but first time use oxygen OS. It is something special.Before it was used iphone 11.
645,Chaitanya Goswami,Performance of mobile is beyond expectations!. It is awesome,5.0,11,8,2021,1,0,"Phone is awesome, performance in every aspect, and mainly it's ui and ux.. oxygen os is really far better than any rom is used till now.. except stock android.. also the AI performance of phone is really great thanks to it's dedicated AI cores. In meditek dimensity 1200 ai SoC... In terms of AI computation this mobile can easily beat even a full sized CISC CPU.Overall the performance of phone is excellent.Just a only thing that I'm concerned of is that 2 units of this model has been reported to get exploded. So It is really a Matter of concern for me also. Hope so nothing bad happens.. and if any manufacturing defects in this model. So OnePlus should thoroughly analyze and if problem is serious they should get all sold unit back with full refund."
646,Abishek,Must buy 🔥,5.0,25,8,2021,1,0,"The Nord 2 is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 1200AI processor and is available in 6GB, 8GB and 12GB RAM options. OnePlus offers 128GB and 256GB storage options but these aren't expandable further Just like other OnePlus smartphones, the Nord 2 also gets OxygenOS and it is running on top of Android 11. You also get two years of software updates and three years of security updates. The Nord 2 is a good performer and can handle heavy tasks and apps without any issues. The 4500mAh battery can go for a day and a half without any issues. Charging is super quick and the phone can get topped up from a drained state in just 32 minutes.  Camera performance of the Nord 2 is good for the price. Daylight photos are good but shots from the ultra-wide angle camera aren't great. The Nord 2 manages close-ups and portrait shots very well. Low light camera performance was also good and with Nightscape mode, the phone can click better shots in lowlight. Overall, the OnePlus Nord 2 is a good pick for someone on a budget."
647,Siddharth Nakashe,Great and Nice Phone,4.0,22,9,2021,1,0,Phone is really good but seems to be bit over budget compared to the other phones in the market. Camera is good but not so impressive as well. Battery life is somewhat okay and same goes with the other features and hardware parts compared with. Good product but not great though.
648,Rahul Prabhakaran,A Perfect Smart Phone with Excellent camera Performance,4.0,4,9,2021,1,1,A perfect phone in all category like performance then 5G with lots of bands support the latest 1200 processor and an excellent camera with 50 MP then it comea with Oxygen OS and Nord 2 is having a Super fast charger along with its box. This phone meets my expectations & value for money phone from One plus.
649,suhil koul,Best overall experience at this budget,5.0,9,9,2021,1,0,"Honestly, I love this phone, it doesn't have the best battery life or performance or anything in particular but what it has is a good experience especially when you are just getting into 30k phone segment,The phone feels decently premium, UI is still better than all its competitors ( MiUi etc), battery backup is decent but it literally chargers in 30mins.( My friend has that poco which is 67 watts and still takes like 50mins to charge) and trust me this is really worth it, speakers are really good, front camera is avg to be honest but main back sensor is actually really good, This is the best phone you can buy if overall experience is what matters to you, if you neither want beastly performance is game or excellent camera just a really well rounded smartphone. Which was true in my case. And trust me its ample fast and has still decent cameras not flagship level but decent."
650,Amazon Customer  will blackberry priv work on Indian bandwidth,Not like it used to be before disappointed,2.0,13,11,2021,1,1,I was a fan of oneplus have been using it since couple of years this time oneplus nord 2 no doubt is a good mobile phone but battery gets drained faster as it's capacity is less screen is not at all bright enough auto brightness makes it dull not clearly visible speakers are excellent allover its just an average phone oneplus has lost its touch that was there
651,Aniket Dave,Good phone but it can blast,1.0,11,11,2021,1,1,I liked the overall product.. fast charging is awesome and camera is also good except wide angle one... The only concern is phones exploding ( as per news) that needs to be resolved by one plus urgently .. atleast release a audit report so that we know what all things to take care of
652,Tushar korde,Camera and battery life not so great,2.0,21,11,2021,1,0,Bought one plus nord 2 instead of nord CE because of camera review was good.... But to my disappointment camera quality is not so great...Camera clicks brighter pictures... Night photos quality is goodMajor issues with battery draining faster while using internet also heats up little while chargingCharging is faster which cope up tiny bit of faster battery draining problemOne plus team needs to work on battery draining issue
653,SHABBIR MOHAMMED,Worst Product by One+,1.0,3,8,2021,1,0,"I did not expect from One+ in the 30K range.I received my handset on 30 July, before that I was very excited about my phone. But after using this handset for two days totally disappointed with the One+ plus orde 2 and feel like cheated.Proc:-1) Only Brand Value or look-wise.2) Charging Speed.Cons.1) Battery drain very fast. Charge two times in a day for normal use like, Viewing videos on youtube, Make videos and clicking images, and playing games.2) Display is not that good, Even 15K phones give a better display.3) Heating issue, even on using camera app or normal use.4) No FM radio.5) No inbuilt music player.6) Google Auto call recorder (inform calling person, then there is no use of call recording)7) Oxygon OS merges with OPPO, Lots of Bugs.Verdict:- Don’t buy One+ Nord 2, please select another phone."
654,Urvil Patel,Justified in this price segment(25000-30000),4.0,3,11,2021,1,0,"I'm writing this review after using this phone(Oneplus Nord 2) for one month.Camera: Decent(4 stars)Refreshing rate: Good (4 stars)Battery Life: If you are turning your hotspot and playing games for a longer time then you have to charge the phone 2 times a day. But, the charging speed is too good and it'll take a maximum of 40-45 mins to get 100% charged (3.5 for Battery life and 4.5 for charging speed)Gaming experience: Decent (4 stars)Heating: Didn't experience it yet. You'll feel slightly warm if you use the phone for >2 hrs continuously.Fingerprint / Face Recognition lock: swift(5 stars)The best option for regular use."

   Main camera is just superb. Never saw such low light photos taken with any smartphone 👌Video is super stable thank to the OIS.The phone is buttery smooth, you can run any game.Battery life is good, charging is just great..A happy user 😊"
656,NIRANJAN BIRADAR,HONEST REVIEW AFTER 35 DAYS,4.0,22,9,2021,1,0,"Firstly I had vivo Y91 before this which was quite avg phone with minimal features.So, this is my first OnePlus phone.Pros1) Runs smooth AF at 90 fps.2) Fast charging (25-30 minutes) and good back up too.3) Comfy in hand4) Good gaming experience but not the bestCons1) Overheating issue is unbelievable. If u play PUBG at ULTRA HD graphics the temp reaches 44°. But HDR is good (yet heating issues exist but not as it happens at ULTRA HD)2) Camera isnt any good. You get 10× zoom but as you zoom into 10× the picture becomes like it's in graphic mode or something or Maybe I don't know the how to rectify it. (Someone help me if u guys know about it)Overall not 'the best phone'. Kindly if u are hardcore gamer consider OnePlus 9 series. And paying 30k and this is the Camera OnePlus offers really disappointed.Also, if your looking for a good phone and not brand name (specially gamers) consider other phones which offer better experience with best prices.If you are really wanting to buy OnePlus wait for OnePlus 9RT it can be better at low price.3.5/5 overall."
657,Tyrmei,Overall a very good phone.,5.0,9,9,2021,1,0,"I've been using this phone for more then 1 month now. And here are some of the things I like about the phone and dislike...Good:-1. I really like the display. The blacks are really black. And also even in outdoors the screen is pretty visible.2. The processor is really good. If you're looking for a gaming device with good looks I would highly recommend this phone.3.  The design is really good and feels premium without the case...Bad:-1.The camera is not as good as I expected it... The colors and the software reminded me of realme which I didn't like at all. If you're really looking for a phone for taking amazing photos Everytime you click, it's better to go for a Google pixel 5A.2. No headphone jack... It may not seem much but this small feature always comes in handy.and I always end up"
658,RAKESH KUMAR,I will advise all the people working under me 4000 VLE to advise not to buy this phone.,1.0,29,8,2021,1,0,"This is what I would say to all the fans of One Plus, never give any opinion from all your acquaintances to buy this phone.  because i was just going to get aaple's phone then some of my friends said that one plus mobile phone is same as aaple's phone so man took this phone but after taking this phone i am so upset that i have to get it all the time  It has to be taken with the charger.  And all the time there is a fear that if I use more then the battery of the phone may not run out, its battery lasts only 4 hours.  That's why my opinion to everyone is that never buy the phone of this company nor give advice to anyone to buy it.  I am the District Manager of Siddharthnagar district under a Government of India company working under the Digital India Project of the Government of India. Now I will also file a case of cheating against this company."
659,Kousik c.,Excellent Mobile,5.0,17,8,2021,1,0,After a lot amount of research I thought to buy the Nord 2 and I am fully satisfied with it. Best phone under 30k. In this segment we see only gaming phones but this one is a all rounder.Camera - 9/10 front camera is good not excellent rear camera is mind blowing( also night mode)🤯Battery - 9/10 The battery gives nearly 7 hrs of SOT which is more enough for any normal user heavy users will get to charge 2 times a dayCharging- 10/10 very quick chargingSound quality and cellular reception10/10 excellent sound quality and good fingerprint reader and microphone no issuesI didn't experience any heating issue it gets warm while charging but that's usual so no worriesIf u are person who game for 2 to 3hrs a day and take photos regularly and requires a good software experience go for it no second thoughts.
660,Life,phone is not a one plus product .,3.0,18,10,2021,1,0,I have been using one plus 3 t for more than 4 n half year . thought would change it coz the display was getting damaged  from down so had to go 4 new .so saw the review n my budget .But this phone gets stuck every now n then it isnt the trademark product of one plus really bad experience
661,Khushali baivshi,Dint like the camera much need more clarity,3.0,3,8,2021,1,5,Okok
662,Skumar,Just not worth it.,1.0,21,9,2021,1,0,"*Problems with one plus nord 2*These are few of what we are going through,-Videos dont work often (be it hotstar, netfix or amazon prime nothing works until restart)-Apps crash often.-Selfie camera is pathetic (gives yellow shade all the time in room light)-Whatsapp video call gets disconnected while maximising most of the times.-Earphones connected via connector don't work at times, audio comes from speaker only.-Constant fear of phone blast (as we have got to know recently) hangs over our head, we have to let our phone cool down if it gets even little bit hot as we are not assured that nothing would happen.-After locking our apps through applock, we dont get to see the details of notifications. There should be an option if we would like to view our notification details or not if the app is locked."
663,Manju Yadav,Awesome features but battery drain fastly,3.0,7,8,2021,1,3,I use it for general purpose still it doesn't last for whole day. If you're heavy user then it will drain in 4-5hours easily. In video calls of 1 hour. It drains 25-30%
664,Dhananjay Pathak,All Rounder phone,4.0,29,7,2021,1,1,"This is very good phone from One plus.Pros-Good build qualityGood designFast chargingGood CameraGood Software experienceCons-No headphone jackBad monochrome 2 MP sensorCamera could be much better, it needs software updates"
665,PRASANNA YELLAPRAGADA,It's not a mobile it's bomb,1.0,17,12,2021,1,0,I purchased this phone out of curiosity towards one plus. This horrified me with it's heat while using. I thought it might explode one day with the amount of heat it generated. Amazon simply given the toll free number of one plus when I complained.  The one plus customer care suggested to visit service center for resolution.  I simply sold it in mobile store even it was loss and bought a new samsung mobile. DO NOT BUY THIS AS I HAVE SEEN SOME NEWS ABOUT EXPLOSION OF THIS MODEL IN NEWS
666,Vihar Somani,Worst phone in 30k range,2.0,2,1,2022,1,0,"This is my first one plus phone and probably the last one as per the experience.I was using Xiomi phone but it was working way better than this one plus phone.Nord 2 has 3 main issues,1. Battery life - In the night when I am not using the phone battery drops 10% and even with the normal usage during day battery will last only 4hours.Any phone of 10-15k INR will work better than this.2.Camera - 32MP front camera is like 16MP camera. Back camera is not able to focus on objects really well.With Color Os, One Plus is now Oppo Plus.You will not be able to see much difference between Oppo's phone and the One Plus's phone.3. Heating Issue - Even with the normal usage and during charging phone will heat to next level.Hope One plus will come up with the update for Battery life atleast."
667,Shahul Hameed,Satisfied with the NORD experience!,4.0,28,8,2021,1,0,"I had been using RN4 for 5 years.Although the phone was in usable condition, i badly needs an upgrade. So i purchased OPN2.i have been using this phone for one week.i will express my candid view about the intial experience.PerformanceFirst of all, MT1200 chipset is a pretty good one.on day to day life experience it works really smooth.thanks for the 90 hz display.it also facilitate to obtain a smooth experience.i have found some glitches on youtube..may be it is a bug.. waiting for the future upadtes to solve this minor issue.other than that i got a smooth experience.BatteryIn battery department i must say this phone is a beast.with the 90 hz display it managed to give a 8-8.30 screen on time.in terms of charging speed it charges super fast  within 35 minutes. 65 w charger works really well.CameraIn this department im not completely satified.camera and athe sensor is too much capable to take good pics. But camera app and software algorithams need polish and is not well optmised at all.back camera works good, but really wants to rely on luck factor.portrait mode is really disappointing one.actually i tried gcam and it gave me some really good portraits. But mt1200 chip is not well optimised for that,so that the app runs really slow.i appreciate front camera.it will give you a natural look and pretty much details in some clicks. But some pics  were washed out and are not completely reliable.media consumptionI completely satisfied at this area.90 hz amoled display will give you a soothing experience.movie experience,youtube playback anything you throw on this department is nearer to perfect experience. That dual sterio speaker is actually really loud and well seperate.In short i found this phone is worth the money.although it has some minor problems."
668,Deepak B.,It's worth the price,4.0,24,11,2021,1,1,"If you are looking for a phone to play games like pubg , BGMI ... And you can trust this phone ,Game won't lag , It runs smooth in higher settings as well , fps doesn't drop ...Pro gaming mode is really good .Also the camera is Gud under this price .Plus you gets many bands of 5g in this , so you don't have to change the phone for a couple of years or may be more ."
669,aakash,All in all while the phones looks good in the online reviews but in realtime usage it disappoints,1.0,3,8,2021,1,0,"Very bad front camera , which stutters and it feels like a 2mp camera that we used to have in old phones.I tried to find reviews before buying but  it looks like oneplus and amazon play well by probably providing better units to reviewers.And also allowing reviews to be added very late so that buyers are left with not much info.Nevertheless, coming to performance of the phone although it boast of dimensity 1200 but still scores less that phones with same processor.The oneplus always lacked camera prowess but I believe that was compensated with better and clean os, but this time that too was taken away as across phone we color os lookwhich makes phone same as realme or oppo.All in all while the phones looks good in the online reviews but in realtime usage it disappoints."
670,Nilay Tamhankar,Battery life & charging.,4.0,30,9,2021,1,0,"Battery life is good and fast charge is awesome. It literally charges from 0% to 100% in less than 1Hr.Camera is good however in video mode if quality is not adjusted properly the video size is huge, for example 1:20min video size will be somewhere between 175-200mb. Other than that no issues with quality.Gaming performance is also good.Could not get the opportunity to try 5g yet but have tried using wifi-5 (device is compatible with wifi-6) browsing speed is awesome.Camera lense can get easily damaged, so have to keep the device upside down."
671,AMIT KARIA,Over Rated Disaster,1.0,18,11,2021,1,1,"1. 2 Jio Sims not working at the same time.2. Server unreachable error most of the times even when emergency calls are to be made3. Call recording announcement, which defeats the purpose of recording.4. No other recording app works on the phone5. Google Dialer very bad, no other dialer works.6. Google Messages App another disaster.Overall - 1 / 10...Huge Waste of Money."
672,Yash,Battery life and display brightness not upto the mark.,3.0,18,8,2021,1,1,"Battery life is not good if you are normal user than ok but for a heavy user you have to juice it up two times a day. But thanks to fast charger it balances the battery life.Display brightness for outdoor in sunlight struggles  it should be more.In- Display Finger print scanner cannot replace the normal scanner. Except these everything is great no lags, good camera, fast apps opening."
673,Ananda Chakraborty,Awesome,5.0,29,7,2021,1,0,I really wait for this device from long time and finally I get this . It is really a good smartphone and performance is also very good.  I like it design which is awesome and the built quality is also very good. It takes 35 minutes to full charge. Camera is also very nice specially the night option in camera.
674,Trisha,Got faulty handset,1.0,4,1,2022,1,0,"I have received a faulty product. The camera was not working properly, a technician came from Amazon and told me it's a software issue. I requested for a replacement, but got to know that I am entitled for a refund only. I didn't understand it because I can see the same handset in stock for the same pincode. However,I am getting a refund and Now I lost the offer which I got on my faulty handset. Not a good experience with the seller and amazon. ordered another handset now, I hope this will be a good one."
675,Vishwajeet Mouar,Overall ratings 8.5/10 .. value for money product,5.0,17,8,2021,1,2,After using it for 10 days ... only issue I found was Heating issue...it gets heated only after after playing hectic games for around  1 hour or so . Biggest plus point is its camera ..it capture beautiful picture. And one more thing I would say is its biometric is at the bottom of display which I liked the most.
676,nilesh satpute,Very well appreciated ☺️,5.0,20,8,2021,1,0,"Phone is awesome 😎..I was eagerly waiting for this phone and very happy now.I have been using this from almost one month and No major issues found in the phone.But while playing games, temperature of phone gets increasing which every phone does that.Camera quality is very well appreciated.Battery back up not that much satiesfied but 65 watts fast charging covers this inconvenience.You just have to keep charger with you all the time.Dimensity 1200 processor gives you smooth experience while playing games and while  using heavy applications.According to me.my decision was right and I'm happy with it."
677,DEBRAJ PAUL,Value for money,4.0,28,7,2021,1,3,Overall a decent and value for money phone..I will post my experience after one month...
678,Its very good quality product,"Not satisfied with this price range, Overall rating is 4.2/5",4.0,23,8,2021,1,1,"Pros:1. Camera Quality and video stability is too good.2. Processor experience is like buttery.3. Screen quality and refresh rate 90 is enough for normal user.4. Build quality and design are truly attractive.Cons:1. Battery draining issue, Nornal usage contains 1 days but jn heavy usage it will last for only 12 hours2. Sometimes facing minor heating issue."
679,Abhishek Rajpurohit,Not worth for 35k. It is overpriced phone.,4.0,9,11,2021,1,0,I bought 12gb 256gb phone. Phone is very good but battery backup was pretty less. If your usage are heavy then 4-5 hr max. I have to charge mobile twice in a day. If they charging 35k then atleast work on battery optimisation. Samsung is better in battery life very long lasting battery.Pros:Camera was good.65W Fast charging.Cons:Battery life is poor charging phone twice in a day.Added colour os which is not good.Phone brightness also very low in day light not properly visible.
680,Punofgod,Best phone under 30k stock experience,5.0,1,8,2021,1,0,"Ordered it within 5 mins of launch.Just go for it...best 30k you will spend.Its fast, clean, beautiful, handy and one of the better camera out there.On screen finger print scanner super fast and convenient.Con : Only thing I can think of is, it feels lighter. It has glass back so I expected it to have more weight"
681,Ashish Mishra,"Worst wide angle camera, rest everything perfect",5.0,22,8,2021,1,1,"Writing this review almost after one month of use, got my phone next day after launch:Pros: Premium design, processor, camera except wide angle, night camera is one of the best. Great for mild gaming, charging is super fastCons: wide angle camera"
682,Krishna,OnePlus in not a OnePlus any more !!!,3.0,28,12,2021,1,0,"The phote heats up sudeenly and to such a extend that you feel the burning sensation.Phone software is also not so smooth, it lags, specially when you wanted to pick a call, you have to literally tap the phone twice or thrice.Phone battery is something you have to worry and need frequent  feeding.This review is a genuine post and you can trust !!!"
683,Roni,An ok phone with good camera,3.0,3,8,2021,1,1,"Good look and feel. But obviously the product has impact from oppo. One plus fonts are gone. Icons from one plus is gone. It's more like an oppo phone. When I tried to update the software, it was showing messages in Chinese. Overall an ok phone with good camera."
684,Umesh kushwaha,Front camera is average and main camera is not good.,4.0,12,8,2021,1,0,"You must read this review.यह रिव्यू आपको जरूर पढ़ना चाहिए।I thought this phone to be a good camera phone. But the camera of this phone is not good as I expected. Front camera is average.  I compared it with my Redmi Y1 , then I got the result of Redmi Y1.  Redmi Y1 selfie better than oneplus nord 2. The details of the OnePlus Nord 2 were more better. But Redmi Y1 skin tone is very good. I don't know it's a bug or reality of oneplus nord 2 camera ? But I'm facing this problem from 30k camera phone. I don't expect this from oneplus.Pros of oneplus nord 21. Charging speed very fast2. Performance is very good3. Design4. Daily use experienceCons of oneplus nord 21. Selfie camera is average like 16k price range smartphone.2. Main camera is very bad i don't know why. ( for human subject photography skin tone is very bad )3. Battery backup is not good. battery drain every 1 hour to 1% average not fixed without using the phone.For your suggestionBakwas camera quality from 30k price rangeMujhe nhi pata ye bug hai ya fir camera esa hi hai me ye problem face kar raha hoon or mene return karna chaha ise toh replacement kar rahe ye log return nhi le rahe haiSo carefully purchase this device from your own risk."
685,Megha,One plus nord 2 - 8 GB  after using 2 days,4.0,30,7,2021,1,0,"Compared with one plus 7 -Performance - refresh rate is fast, faster mobileScratch - one scratch on top of mobile body which is made of Steel, colour fade. But I can ignore this.Camera - low light shots click awesome, images are sharp, selfie & it add white shade in back & front camera normal mode.AI feature in camera - if you are in low light it will start flash, auto detect camera mode.Sound - good to hear like playing something on speakers but it's phone.Instagram & hot start videos - I seen some videos looks blurr. But I checked with one plus offical mobile release video. It's looks correct to me.Charging - in 20 to 30 mins it will get charged.Cost - if one plus give it in 25000 then it's best mobile in market. But it's good as new features you received.Best in market for such price. I would suggest don't buy mobile higher than 30k. This is good for people looking for 20k to 30k."
686,Abhishek,It's not OnePlus anymore,1.0,16,8,2021,1,0,"It's another android mobile...don't compare it with op series.Poor interfaceTerrible cameraHangAuto re-startHeating issueNetwork connectivity issueUr all data is being shared with Chinese app for which u give a confirmation at the first time of using the phone...all ur photos , location etc.Suggest it to someone u have a grudge on.."
687,Vineeth H,Restart Issue,1.0,17,8,2021,1,0,I liked this phone overall however I returned this product since I was facing major restart issue every now and then even with using only social media apps.I am not an ardent phone user however was disappointed that this phone couldnt even match it and kept restarting again and again.Thank you Amazon for refunding the entire amount with no grievance.
688,Shweta,"Good phone under 30k, not the best.",4.0,1,8,2021,1,0,"Fingerprint reader is a bit slow. Like takes approx a twentieth second more than other. No issues with face unlock though.Phone needs to be charged twice daily. For rough usage.Gaming is good. Battery backup is efficient while gaming and no major heat issues. I played for approx 3 -4 hours.No headphone jack, but the alert slider is included.Charging takes approx 30-35 minutes for full charge.Other phones provide 120fps In this price range.(realme x7 max, Poco f3 gt)Camera is great. The night mode is also good.The mixture of color OS and Oxygen OS in this phone doesn't feel like a premium oneplus phone like the 9 series. Its like Oppo phones, but I've got no issues with it.So overall a great deal. I liked this one."
689,Jaison Thomas,Great phone in 30k range. Just go for it.,5.0,5,10,2021,1,0,Got this phone on 2nd Oct. This is my initial review and i will write another review after using this phone for a month. As of now Performance is really good. Camera clarity is awesome. I bought grey color and this is really a great choice. Display is superb. Fingerprint and Face unlock is really good. Gives a classy feel. Overall it's a good choice in 30k range.
690,Arijit Nath,Great Phone in premium midrange budget,4.0,31,7,2021,1,0,The best Nord series phone from OnePlus.Pros:65W charging speed6.43 inch fluid amoled screenGood back cameraMediatek 1200 processor6 SA 5G bandsSmooth snappy performanceCons:No 3.5 mm headphone jackColorOS is creeping into OxygenOS120 hz refresh rate missingBattery is average
691,Aru,Don't Buy this phone,2.0,20,10,2021,1,0,I have been using this phone for more than 2 months.First time I choose one plus because of it's brand name....but finally disappointed.-The phone battery drains very fast....and --front camera not up to mark- Major Heating issues in October and in indoor it heats like a cup of a hot tea.Please Don't waste your valuable money on such phone. It's not worth it even under 20k.Don't go with the brand name...after using this phone it feels like we're using an oppo phone.There is nothing to give 30k to this garbage.
692,Rakshith B B,Value for money,4.0,13,11,2021,1,0,"Good to purchase, battery backup is good with normal usage but when used extensively it comes for around 12 hrs Max but since 65w wrap charger is provided it charges faster in 30mins to 100%Must have provided 120Hz refresh rate but 90Hz is often matchable.Didn't see any issues like heating, hanging till now.Oxygen 11 with color OS gives great UI experience.Camera quality is good when compared to other Nord phones and great wrt night image enrichment.With MediaTek Dimensity 1200AI Processor I feel fast access.Good phone to buy in this price range!!"
693,Rahul Prajapati,Performance is really good,4.0,11,8,2021,1,2,Pros:1.Deaign is excellent2.Performance is good3.Screen has awesome views.4.Charging is super fast.Cone:1.Battery draining too fast.2.Fingerprint should be more accurate.3.In hand feels too sileperry.

695,Shrinivas,1+ Nord2 is a total waste of money.. Never buy it.,1.0,2,9,2021,1,0,"Battery drains out in 3-4 hours ( specially when hot spot is on)Worse quality camera, can't even focus on flower, makes it totally blur,Selfie adds unnecessary makeup, even to boys, Boys look like girls ... ( 0 rating to camera outof 5)And many other issues as well with cameraDoesn't catch network where normal, cheapest phone catch very easilyThough 5g, it gives the feel of 2g phone.This is the first and last time I am buying 1+ phone...Totally disappointed...Total total total waste of money... Never buy it..."
696,Rajan Sharma,Overall a good phone.,4.0,12,8,2021,1,0,"I am writing this review only after 1 day of usage. So, here's my experience with the phone as it is my 1st phone from 1+.First of all when i tried to start the phone for the very 1st time, it was kindaa stuck in the bootloader for more than 10 minutes and restarted about 3-4 times. I thought that 1+ might have provided me with a glitched phone but afterall it started somehow.Screen on time i was getting is about 6 hrs with 20% battery remaining. I was using phone in 90 fps and internet was on all the time.Phone heats upto 45° while playing BGMI and wide angle camera sucks. Front camera is not upto the mark."
697,Vineet,Issue with Battery. All other things are Great,3.0,4,10,2021,1,0,"Everything is great except Battery Life. Even on a two week old phone getting through the day is impossible. Without any gaming, making videos or social media scrolling, battery drops to 40% before 4PM. Just normal Whatsapp, news and little bit of other apps can cause drastic battery reduction. Although wrap charger is extremely fast, but can't keep searching sockets everywhere to charge."
698,Vinay C Shaju,"Heating issue , okay camera , screen is okay , smooth",4.0,29,7,2021,1,0,"As of now I am having heating issuesThere are lot of bugs in the softwareBattery is draining faster than expectedFront cam is not so greatUI is having some issue after this merger with color OS .can't see battery graph .no reading modecan't adjust the color properly to warm or cool tone (the range is very less )Edit after 2 updatesHeating issues got resolved after the updates , the phones is no longer heating , infact temperature never gets warm in most scenario ,Some of the bugs got resolvedBattery life improved a lot"
699,Satyendra Balot,Not as expected from oneplus,2.0,9,1,2022,1,0,"I had purchased first one plus 3 phone, which has excellent features and camera quality, later I  had purchased one plus 5t, which too has excellent camera picture quality, however when I saw the picture quality of one plus Nord 2 5g, it is not as good as provided by my previous one plus smartphones, and I totally regretted the purchase of the same. I recommend not to purchase this phone by seeing less price, compared to  one plus 9. As they with price, they compromised the quality also...Instead u can go for any other OPPO or VIVO phone which will give you better picture quality and features at a lesser price than one plus....."
700,Amazon Customer,Writing after Month . First time Oneplus user,5.0,10,9,2021,1,1,"I became fan of Oneplus Nord 2 after month usage.PROS:-Camera,Fast Charging,User friendly UI,Smooth working,CONS:-Battery discharge is high when using continously.Overall performance is very good."
701,PRAFUL TRUPKANE,Camera main sensor is fantastic but struggles in Low night...,3.0,14,9,2021,1,0,Mono and ultrawide lens are seems useless...Battery back is little less but u will neva feel that due to its massive 65W charger...which will charge ua phone in no time....does anyone facing sensor issue like during calls screen will off when we touch our phone to ear and when we resume the phone to use...its screen doesn't wake up immediately...Or its my screen gaurd issue...
702,KRANTI KHODRE,Contact Search Very Slow For Text Massage,1.0,12,8,2021,1,2,इस मोबाइल से मेसेज भेजने के लिए कांटेक्ट नंबर सर्च करने में बहुत ज्यादा समय लगता हैं करीब 30 सेकंड लग रहे है कांटेक्ट नवम्बर सर्च मेंमेसेज भेजने के लिए जैसे ही कॉन्टैक्ट नाम टाइप करते है तो टाइप नाम सर्च करने में 30 से 40 सेकंड लग रहे हैंऐसा मेने पहली बार देखा है कि नाम सर्च में इतना टाइम लग रहा है
703,Suraj,The phone met all my expectations,5.0,3,9,2021,1,0,I needed a combo of flawless gaming performance and feature-full camera that gives me quality pictures. OnePlus Nord2 just satisfies me with my requirements. I didn't feel any drawback of headphone jack unavailability. Phone has a great bluetooth connectivity and no issues when in calls or even gaming. There are alot of in-built features in the phone. I am still exploring. There's a exclusive feature called as pro-gaming which is great for gamers.

705,Nikhil Tyagi,Average piece with poor battery and average performance,3.0,2,9,2021,1,1,"Super pathetic battery life without even using it discharge withing 14 15 hours and if I use it continuously use it then goes down in 8 9 hours max, camera is below average, UI is not upto the mark same with performance thing some times hang up and heat up most of the times, could have been more better in this price range.Need to optimise it so that battery life goes up with more performance."
706,Amazon Customer,Ultimate camera phone,5.0,3,10,2021,1,0,"This is my first one plus.I was looking for a good camera phone,this phone camera both front and rear camera is ultimate in picture clarity compare to all other phones not even oppo.There is no issue as such.this is the latest phone with latest os and basic priced in one plus. Iam happy with new one plus.. thanks"
707,Nitin,Perfect Phone 📱,5.0,20,11,2021,1,0,"I was in big dilemma to buy this phone or not due to multiple news of PHONE BLAST.I have tested this phone in multiple manner but still no issue found even not getting heating up.Charging time is very less and good with compare to price.One thing I am disappointed a bit that's the price 29,999 because my friend bought same phone from ONE PLUS Store @28,499Phone's touch sensor is amazing.Battery Life is really good so far.Rest if something happens within first 90days I will surely update here."
708,Amazon Customer,Don't buy this product,1.0,19,10,2021,1,2,"Dera all mobile buyers , don't buy this mobile phone, it's true review, I'm feeling very bad selection this mobile, after one month this mobile will Start problem hanging, not working properly, customer service also very bad, pls don't buy this product"

Feel some camera Issues also as the picture comes blurred. Little disappointing, considering OnePlus, a Brand. I preferred it over iPhone but got disappointment. I can't return it as the return window is closed."
711,Ashutosh,Overall good phone but minor software glitches!,4.0,7,2,2022,1,0,"Bought my phone on 4th Feb 2022!Pros- Overall good phone with fast processor!Gestures and camera quality is good.Cons- minor software glitch eg during game when add appear, it fails to revert Back to game once ad ends. I have to close game window and again start the game.Rest time will tell"
712,Venkata Dharma J,Don't go for this and waste your money,2.0,3,2,2022,1,0,"To keep it in silent mode you have to use side button and there is no option in phone, just like Nokia in 90s. For call acceptance or rejection there is only one option if you swipe up acceptance and if you swipe down rejection, it would be always better to give 2 separate buttons.There is no audio jack and you to go with wireless headphones. The UI is too pathetic looks like it was designed 15 years back. The only good thing is battery life and quick charging. There is no special in this phone. 5k or 6k phones are better than this and they are more options in good looking UI. My suggestion is don't go for this and waste your money. 35k is too much and not worth even 5k."
713,KULDEEP SINGH,Everything is superb only ultrawide is bakwaaaaaaaas,4.0,10,8,2021,1,2,Battery life is not that great but thanks to fast charging due to it manages.Fingerprint is snappy works so fast.Camera quality is good every time only ultrawide is bakwaaaaaaaas

I can't here voice properly. I checked so many times about this issue if I disconnect with wifi I can hear properly..3) Battery life is not good .. as per expectation4) lots of network problem..5) no default Call recording ... And also it announce call is recording.. It's a review after using  1 month.. my best suggestion is please don't buy it.. go with other.Not worthy for your valuable money.. it's a lot of people dreams to buy good cell phone.."
715,Ravi Soni,Bit expensive not worth 30k,3.0,7,2,2022,1,0,Well this one definitely looks good brand value is good. But in my view the device should cost not more than 20k. Did not feel a wow factor except its charging which is amazing. Stereo sound is cheap like a low budget phone. I am not a camera user so no comments on that.  3 star is enough for the device.
716,Saurabh Kumar Singh,Please don't buy.High Cost & low performance..,2.0,29,7,2021,1,1,"Touch & look is awesome but I am very disappointing because inbuilt App Cloning is not working, no inbuilt fitness app..I think we can choose better option in same price range.Product is not worthy as compare to cost..Overall product is not as per my expectations.."
717,Amazon Customer,Not Expected this from OnePlus. Think Twice before Buying.,2.0,31,8,2021,1,0,"First time purchased OnePlus and very disappointed over its frequent app crash specially camera app. Selfie camera also captures blank pictures if you preview after taking picture, then you have to restart phone. Not expected from such expensive phone.Performance and Wifi is Good. Battery Charging is superb.Request One Plus to fix bugs asap."
718,Lalit,Unsafe,1.0,10,9,2021,1,1,Phone is heating randomly. Feeling very unsafe to use the phone with the ph blasting newsIt's always on the mind that something wrong will happen. when i use the phone my hand feels some wrong vibes. Don't want to use the phone anymore.I want to return the phone.
719,Mr. Verma,Lena hai toh le lo review par mat jao...,5.0,6,8,2021,1,2,zaruri nahi sab ka phon kharab nikle.. mera toh shi hai.. baki game wagera khailne wale he roo rahe normal use k lye shi.Battery chal jati hai thik thak par charge bhy jaldi ho jata hai..Jo camera k lye bol rahe un se anurodh hai phon ki jagh camera he lo..
720,Vaibhav Singh,Perfect phone under 30k,5.0,31,7,2021,1,0,"Nord 2 ticks all the boxes in terms of specifications. You can get Dimensity 1200 for quite a less price, but not the build quality and UI experience. Have been using this for the past week and have still not faced any issue with the device.Display is HDR10+ and is sufficiently bright outdoors. But the battery drains very swiftly if Video enhancement modes are on.Battery lasts you 12-14 hours on medium to high usage on full charge. The phone gets fully charged in 35-40 minutes.Camera is quite good. Only A52 4G has OIS in this range. Night shots are particularly very good because of OIS. There is Gyro EIS for videos also, which renders very stable videos. Wide Angle Camera is not so great, but gets you clear images.Oxygen OS 11.3 has now few features from the Color OS ( Camera UI and some changes in settings ), which is a good thing in my opinion as Color OS has pretty good customisation options. UI is nearly stock.The device has no IP rating but is splashproof and the sim tray has rubber protection.Device has only two cons - It has no 3.5 mm jack and you do not get connector in the box. The other is that the device is quite slippery because of the frosted glass back ( Grey Sierra  )."
721,Durgesh,Totally Fake Product,1.0,3,9,2021,1,1,Koi bhi bhai mt lena es phone ko battery backup bilkul bekar h full charge krne ke baad batter apne aap kam hoti rehti h bina use kiye .. or aapko koi help nhi milegi Amazon ki traf se agr aapko ye psnd nhi h to Amazon bs keh deti h ki oneplus ke customer care me jao..  camera quality bhi normal h jitna btaya gya tha us hisab se best nhi h..

No boatware.Too many customization available at setting/security/gesture level.You can't get more then this at this range. 🙌
723,Karthik,Color os Uhhh... 🥺,1.0,20,8,2021,1,0,"Uhhhh...Color OS has ruined the premiuness and auto call record feature has been theown away from all BBK electronic mobiles. Will never go for oneplus series..... No security just like Knox or thinkshield. Waste of money. Wireless charger may be given, display size is average and not having 120hz. But considering the price range it's ok."
724,Amazon Customer,Awesome Purchase!,5.0,10,8,2021,1,0,"The best midrange Oneplus smartphone till date! Been using the phone for 2 weeks now & the things which i loved about the device is1. Flagship Camera (Sony sensor)2. Performance ( Great Processor with AI integrated)3. Brilliant Connectivities ( Wifi 6 & storage 3.1, 7- 5G bands)4. Design & build qualityThe battery is not bad at all, it last for a day easily and it charges the device 0-100 in just 33 minutes (That's impressive)Overall a great purchase, would recommend for people who are looking for a oneplus midrange smartphone with great camera, performace & design."
725,Amazon Customer,Shaky and unclear slow Mo videos,3.0,1,8,2021,1,2,I am facing an issue. The slow motion videos are not good and are shaky.Without flash light it is recording slow Mo videos in a pathetic quality. Just want to ask if this is in nord 2 defect or the defect in the piece that I have received.
726,Amit Pareek,Wonderful Battery and Awesome Charging,5.0,14,9,2021,1,0,"It's 12.29 am in the night and I am reviewing it right now after my 1 day of full usage, I charged my phone at 10.00 am yesterday and it's still 54%. I use to use iphone 8, and the battery use to drain out at 6-7 pm daily based on my usage. With the same usage I still have 54% battery left. I was a still worried with only 4500 mah battery but the result my phone has shown due to its processor and Ram is simply unbelievable. I have become. Fan of one plus after using my Nord 2.Diplay is awesomeBattery and Charging is fantasticLooks - It's One Plus.

728,NF,A huge disappointment,1.0,30,9,2021,1,1,A huge disappointment as product is a refurbished one as the charger doesn't suit for this mobile. The charger is supposed to be 65w but what I received was 30w charger. I dnt understand how Amazon does these kind of activities of sending refurbished product to a genuine customer. This matter i came to know only after charging the mobile.
729,Parth Soni,Justice to price.,4.0,14,10,2021,1,0,"I am writing this review after two days of use. Main thing about this device is it gives premium look and feel. It gives justice to the price. And as per my view this is the best device in this range, I also read many reviews before buying this but i feel many of them are quite wrong about heating problem as i see it is not heating that much. But i must say it requires more battery power while using but on stand by it is taking a lot less then other devices. If we talk about performance it is great.

But it's a good phone. Lil bugs here and there but I guess they'll be fixed in updates. Front camera is 32 MP, but my One plus 7- 16MP was better. Low light results are average. Feel is good and almost premium. Decent Phone for 30K."
733,Robin Mathew,Super smooth Nord 2 😍,5.0,30,7,2021,1,0,"Really amazing phone. Initially I was confused to pick a phone since poco GT is also a great choice in this price range, but finally I decided to go on with the one plus experience. From the  first week experience I would say the phone is really smooth with the oxygen os and fast charging is super amazing. Phone battery is good, I still have some 20-30 percentage left end of day. So really happy in this area. I was a bit disappointed with the blue colour should have opted for grey instead. But that is a personal opinion. Overall really happy with the purchase."

Many technical/software bugs, even not able to perform full functionality in the basic inbuilt applications.2. Unable to edit numbers on calculator, it's basis requirement.3. Unable to do conference calling, when I try to conference it just gets discounts automatically.4. Heating issues now and then (I just use basic additional applications)5. I have logged a ticket with one plus Nord support team. They mentioned, it will get resolved in next OS updates but I'm affraid after hearing the blast case.6. Support team mentioned they will take remote access and try to resolve the heating issues. I'm just hoping it will get sorted out.7. My return policy is expired otherwise I would have returned this product."

Came across slight heating issue while charging. The AmoLED display is awesome. Bluetooth and Connectivity is also on good side. The AI camera is not up to the mark (adds unnecessary blur), also there is some noise in normal photo mode as compared to portrait mode.The processor is very fast and efficient , no glitches or lags observed.Stereo speakers perform very good ,but I feel headphone jack should have been provided.Overall nice mobile and lives to the expectations of OnePlus Brand name"

And processor is also bery good....."
738,Amazon Customer,Is it gray?,5.0,29,7,2021,1,0,"Just so the customer is clear on the color gray, it has a tint of blue so you can call it a lighter shade of pigeon gray not the charcoal or any darker side. The pictures are not showing the correct colors for me.Otherwise, no need to add words to phone review. Runs great, feels good in hand.Although I did not like the fact there are so many apps (google and oneplus) which require permissions the first time we setup device or use them first. Cant say if there would be privacy issues."
739,Soumen Maiti,waste of money,1.0,11,9,2021,1,0,"1. After using the iPhone for the last 6 years, I found The security system in this phone(ONEPLUS NORD 2 5G) is not good enough. Anyone can break the security in less than 2 min. The phone asking permission to manage phone calls, photo gallery, location. every time even you open the camera the first time. Still, I don't understand what is the connection between phone calls and camera? I open the camera the first time it asks me to give access to manage phone calls. In privacy and policy, some data can be sent to CHINA, WHY?2. I have no complaint about processor. it works well.3. 32MP front camera, waste of money. need to improve a lot.Overall I do not recommend this phone."

U can't see downloaded images and vdo's in Gallery from whatsapp6. When u get call, for few seconds the name of person won't appear on the screen and u can see the name only after sometime7.

In terms of browsing application mobile feels premium, it doesn't put external apps other then Google apps in ram.2. Front camera is Just ok ok, previously using mi A2 takes better selfies. Rear camera even worst when click on human subject makes whitish face, get 1 better shot out of 6. Camera is only for natural photography not for human subject3. Battery backup is good easily get one day in single charge, charge from 0 to 100 within 35 minutes4. Wifi speed is getting better than other phones,data speed also good due to having more supported bands5. Gaming experience is also good on this6. Con is mainly camera, doesn't put external apps in ram due to this multitasking not so good,poor ram management, apps are not present in ram7. This phone is good for those who don't uses much camera,only engage in daily activities like phone calls, messages, whatsapp, NetflixBattery charging is fastCamera quality very poorNot worth of 30k getting better option in market,go for Snapdragon processor phones"
742,Sonali Gole,Killer performance of 2021!!,5.0,26,8,2021,1,0,"this is really one of the best phones of 2021 so far, let me very first talk about UI of stock android which literally makes you look at this diva again & again!! performance is smooth like butter, no lagging or glitching at all & another best thing is how this device feel in hands!! PERFECT!! battery life is outstanding i literally used my phone for more than 24 hrs & one of the great thing is it's battery charging speed is beyond way!! it charges your phone upto 70 % in just 10 to 12 min!! i mean what a BEAST it is!!

Camera is pretty good but at some positions it was not upto the mark.I have used OnePlus Nord and I feel this the perfect successor in every field like display, camera , speaker, battery life, charging speed,etc.So totally satisfied with its overall performance.It is completely all rounder at this price range because at this price some have good  performance while lacking in camera while some having good display but lacking in performanceSo it is the best phone in this price segmentIt is also future proof as it supports 9 5g bands not like others supporting only 2 5g bands."

752,Charu gupta,Not worth for 30K,2.0,11,9,2021,1,0,"I am not satisfied with this product. I was using iPhone and thought to try One Plus this time. I can feel the difference between an iPhone and Andriod but must say that no one can beat the iPhone experience. The one plus battery is poor and I need to charge twice a day. This is not good for travellers or gamers.The front camera is 32 megapixels but it is like a normal phone. The rear camera is awesome and clicks good pictures. The 100% phone charges in 30-45 minutes only which is a +ive. However, there is news of phone blats that make me scary. I will not suggest spending 30 K on this phone. You will get the same experience on 15-20 k phones only so there is no need to spend this amount"
753,roshantp,Good Mobile - But 30k is expensive.,3.0,22,8,2021,1,1,"Initially battery life was pathetic but after couple of updates .it's ok now. Fast Charging time is exciting. Overall good experience but if you ask me does it worth for 30k , definitely no. Nothing interesting or special for 30k"
754,Amazon Customer,Good Product but pathetic delivery and exchange process,2.0,31,8,2021,1,0,"Product is good so far, no hassle but the way it was delivered was crazy. The exchange now demands that you don't do a factory reset on the phone till they verify via Amazon app running on the phone to be exchanged. If you have an older version of phone , the amazon app does not work on it. So you have to update everything and keep the phone as it was till the delivery person comes to your house. Chances of Data Leakage- Very High. A lot of Wastage of time also, as you have to do a factory reset and other data deletion after it is accepted for exchange. You 1 or 2 hours may be wasted and if the app doesnt work, God only can help you."
755,Satish.  S,Good Budget Phone for normal usage,4.0,28,8,2021,1,0,"Here's my review after a month of usage. Firstly I liked it's glass back it looks & give a premium feel nd very attractive. Coming to the performance it's very smooth in day to day normal usage, I didn't notice any lags, stutter or app crashes. Im not a gamer so not tested in that zone. Otherwise it takes very good still daylight and night pics. 8 mp nd 2 mp is crap of no use, have not tested on video part. Battery backup is decent nd fast charging is just awesome. Overall its not for gamers, for normal day to day users its just fit. If u want clean UI and smooth performance go for it."
756,Sujit W,Overall experience is good. Amazon has delivered it on time.,4.0,9,10,2021,1,0,"Writing this review after usage of 2 weeks. Experience, rating may get change after mid to long term usage. Overall product is good, worth to buy. Amazon has delivered it on time with tampered proof packaging.Found voice sound quality of this phone is very good. Overall touch screen, fingure sensors response is upto mark.In this price tag, camera, photo quality could have been better.Cons: No complaint as such but battery life could have been betterCons: No SD card supportCons: No 3.5 audio jack. You can manage it by putting cport to 3.5 jack convertor. Since it is burdon on poket, OnePlus should have provided it as a standard port.Overall rating 4/5."
757,Soumyobrata Sen,OnePlus Nord 2- The Allrounder,5.0,28,7,2021,1,0,"Got the Grey Sierra model on thr first sale. Here are my thoughts after 48 hours of usage-1. The camera- One word: Incredible. HUGE step-up from the previous generations and almost can go neck to neck with flagship cameras. The selfie camera is good too. Will update some photos after i take this phone outdoors. Wide angle camera is ok, nothing special. But the selfie camera is also great. There are some negetivity for hsing Oppo's camera app. But i see that as a great plus point. There's bokeh video, AI color focus and some portrait features only found on Oppo phones. And we know oppo is pretty good in cameras. And the night mode is outstanding2. Design and In- hand feel- Feels Solid. The grey Sierra model looks absolutely wonderful. Compact design and very comfortable to hold.3. Display- general 90hz amoled panel. But lack of HDR 10 support. Overall a good display.4. Haptics- An Absolute joy to type and engage with the phone. The haptics feel extremely premium. There is no buzzy motor.5. "" OXYGEN OS ""- Yes there are some color os elements in Oxygen os, but it still works and feels like one. Color os is not a bad UI at all, people who have used it know that. I've used Color Os 11 and it's pretty close to stock with some great personalization features. But still we want oxygen os to be oxygen os. If they take the good from color os there's no problem.6. Mediatek Dimensity 1200- from initial use the phone is extremely snappy and responsive. However from the benchmark scores this one scores a bit lower than the regular Dimensity 1200 devices. Maybe the reason being the higher clocked 3.0 ghz core is underclocked at 2.6 ghz, as per CPU-Z app. Maybe a software update can fix that if that was not unintentional.7. Speakers- Stereo speakers are loud. Although the bottom firing speaker is louder. 70% sound comes from that. 30% comes from the earpiece speaker. Overall a good experience.8. Battery and charging- the 6nm processor can hold on for a day and half. And you can always use the 65W charger, and it charges the phone Insanely fast.9. Verdict- Realme X7 Max and POCO F3 GT may seem like a better value for other people but the OnePlus Nord 2 provides all around performance from gaming to camera performance. Also the UI is such a plus point for this phone. 90hz is fine as a display, also helps in battery consumption. If you're not completely into gaming or if you have 30k budget, you can absolutely go for the Nord 2."

764,Parth,Best Smartphone,5.0,1,8,2021,1,0,All things Perfect in this phone expect battery life. Battery life is not as expected for 4500mAh battery. If you regularly chat or surf with screen on it will hardly last 4-5 hours . Means you have to charge twice a day atleat leavings sleeping hours otherwise 3 times a day 😅.OnePlus have thought about battery life even I have MI and Samsung with little more than half a price gives me 2 days of back up with same usage .But 65W warp charge does this ..... 25 min 0-100 % .That's why I am giving 5 star .Please fix battery draining very fast issue with update .

No heating issues, no gaming issues. Although I am a working professional so I don't have much time for games. For general usage, it's good and without any regret. Always try to restart phone once in a day. Close all background apps when not in use and do not overcharge the phone . Charge only when battery goes below 30 %, then charge it to full.Every electronic gadget or phone should be used accordingly. It will work fine always. I don't have any issues with any phones I purchased back from Amazon.Thank you Amazon for making everything easy and justified."

And also when I asked for replacement / refund then also no one customer service had entertain for this issue, then we buy OnePlus by giving much higher amount then another if there is no customer satisfaction."

But my excitement really hadn't last longer. The phone is heating lot. Batter is draining. When I making calls the calls are dropping. I didn't expect one plus to sell phones like these. Even without testing quality of their phones. Things I liked is oxygen os which is smooth and speakers. Display and camera is average. I don't recommend this device.

Other smartphones from different brands have there on UI's filled with bloatwares and you can't do anything about it.

798,umang,Camera Quality,1.0,26,8,2021,1,1,Ok so let's talk about camera Quality.OnePlus Nord 2 camera is awesome but abhi ruko if you are useing  50 MP camera so after clicking one picture you need to wait for 5 minutes because your camera automatically turn off and you are not able to use camera againe for 5 minutes and I am sure after one month I'll share my full reviewThanks
799,Prateek,Good buy! Super upgrade from the previous Nord versions..,5.0,30,7,2021,1,0,"Recieved the product on 27th July. It's been 3 days. The most astonishing feature is the charging, it takes less than 40 mins to full charge if battery less than 10%. Smooth interface, doesn't hang. Good graphics, looks like One Plus 9R model, looks better than the previous Nord version.Only con for me is the absence of the 3.5 mm jack, otherwise all good."
800,sandesh pandit,No cost EMI is myth they are giving extra discount and then charging 1.3333% interest.,4.0,15,8,2021,1,1,Everything is perfect except the wide angle camera pics seems desaturated.No cost EMI is myth they are giving extra discount and then charging 1.3333% interest.

801,Narendra Singh Inda,"Substandard build quality, horrible build quality from one plus",1.0,18,8,2021,1,2,"Phone build quality is horrible, not what is expected from one plus. Back side glass so fragile that even with the cover delivered with the phone, back side glass shattered with just putting it on the table. Such fragile build quality was not expected from one plus.  Waste of money."

Already heard a couple of news of Nord2's explosion, which is very scary.Camera quality is not good, images are not sharp and get lot of softness in the photos.Battery backup is not good, can last only upto 5-6hrs.Charging speed is very fast however battery doesn't last for long.Really disappointed with this phone at this price range."

In-Display finger print sensor is good but slow... 4500mAh battery takes only 30mins to reach 100% from 0%... The sound quality and loudness is incomparable with other mobile phones... Display quality is Amazing...
808,Syed Muhammad Nihal,Overall a decent mobile,4.0,28,8,2021,1,0,Its been 5 months since I'm using this device.Camera is impressive with added features.I don't play games so Dimensity 1200 is pretty good for my activities.Battery is good.If you are a medium user it lasts for a day.If you are a heavy user it gives nice backup.Full charge time is 30 minutes.Display is nice because of amoled panel.If you switch from 120hz to 90hz you will feel the difference.If you switch from a old device to this you will feel this smoother.Haptics are impressive.The  problems i am facing now is the white light (flash) turns on automatically when I switch to front camera.
809,Shailesh s s,Good product! Buy it!,4.0,2,11,2021,1,0,Very good device. Charges full in 33 mins. I feel battery backup isn't great. It's good but I feel it could have been better as it has only 90hz display.Good back camera. Poor front camera. Even phones with 20k price have better front camera.worst selfie cam. no heating issue for normal usage. No problems faced. U can buy it without any worry. Smooth as f. very clean UI. u can contact me if u have any doubt.Edit - after 40 days of usage .I have no problem with the device ..I am getting screen on time of 7 hours 30 mins..I am going to attach a screenshot of it.
810,JDass,Good phone but bad press.,4.0,11,11,2021,1,1,It's a sturdy and responsive phone. No complaint about its quality or performance. But recent news of its batteries randomly bursting is a cause of concern. The company must recall all the phones to address this issue.
811,RG,Average phone with big budget,3.0,21,10,2021,1,0,"After using one month the feedback isPros -Phone Aesthetic is good,Rear Camera is Very goodCons -Front camera performance is patheticDuring video call, front camera image gets stillWhile surfing Photo gallery or website, phone gets hang or badly slows down.Heat up while charging as well with little heavy use.Couldn't feel the effect of 8 GB RAM"
812,Vishal,Overhyped product,4.0,6,11,2021,1,0,"To be honest the phone is overhyped...Best things- Superfast charging- decent camera- nice UIWorst things- fingerprint scanner is so so annoying, i can't tell u, how irritating it is.. it fails to read thumbs 5 out of 10 times...- overweight (200 gm, without cover),(225 gm with cover)- front camera is pathetic, also video stabilization in main camera is so poor (Real disappointment)- Some apps face regular bugs... But updating theim resolves the issue ( Irritating sometimes)"
813,Kunal Bhagwan Shirsath,Battery Drain is very fast . very Average phone this is..,2.0,27,8,2021,1,0,"Battery Drain was fast . After using last 2 days and full charge for some time & enable all battery optimization settings . Reduce refresh rate 60khz . Its look good backup & less battery draining now. But Cammer AI environment is not good . Its making every image as animated . You find this issue after 2x,5x zoom of camera images . I feel its not giving you original clear image . Previous technology like pixel breking after zoom was much better than current animated AI effects . OnePlus should looks into it."
814,Arjun Nair,Superb,5.0,3,1,2022,1,0,Fully feature loaded phone with a good camera and top notch displayOnly point where its a thumbs down is the battery life - although the warp 65 charger takes only 12 minutes to charge it to more than 90% but still the juice doesn't last for more than 15-18 hours
815,Shalender Nath,A good phone,4.0,28,8,2021,1,0,"A good phone to buy.Pros:-1. Main camera is great.2. Performance is good.3. UI is great.4. Battery is good and charger is great.5. Ram management is great.6. Design is great.7. Display is great.Cons:-1. 90Hz diplay and not 120Hz2. Fingerprint scanner working is a bit slow, little bit slow as i thought (may be okay to you).3. Front camera is 32mp but not working like 32, it's working like 16mp (it may improve after update but i m not sure).Overall a balanced phone without any ads or bloatware.I want to give 4.5 out of 5"
816,Amandeep Sharma,Worst camera and battery,4.0,18,1,2022,1,1,It's worst mobile in segment price 30k because battery life too poor and camera quality too worst. Please go to MI OR SAMSUNG IF YOU HAVE TO BUY MOBILE SEGMENT 30k.  in price segy 30k OnePlus Nord worst mobile if OnePlus not to fixed bug of camera and battery I also bin that mobile and purchase another mobile like my opinion buy Mi or samsung
817,dr.parimal ranajan de,Nice phone,4.0,26,8,2021,1,0,The phone is very nice.. battery life is little low. 1 single charge wil go till 1 day if ur not doing any gaming or video call . Camera is pretty good I liked it actually. Charging is very fast. 30mins n ur phone wil b fully charged. Very fast processor

820,Mukesh Kumar,Not upto the MARK,3.0,29,1,2022,1,0,"Pros:1.) Display is good and refresh rate is Ok2.) Wrap charging gives me a fantastic full charge within minutes.3.) Dual Speaker gives good Audio performanceCons:1.) HEATING ISSUE  -Sometimes while charging it heats tremendously without reason.At that time I think about Oppo parent comapny resemblence to this.2.)Camera is not upto the mark,poor clarity when I zoom it either while shooting and the images as well.3.) UI -Color OS not have any unique speciality when attached to Oxygen.Thinking about is it worth for money after 1month rigorous use."
821,Rajat Kumar Sahoo,Just go for it,5.0,31,7,2021,1,0,If your budget is around 30k then just go for it. Pretty much satisfied with the phone. Not a heavy Gamer and for daily uses its awesome with good camera and display.  Charging speed is good and back camera is also outstanding. And most important thing is OnePlus oxygen os. Clean and cool os and those who are complaing about camera interface it's good actually with some new features.
822,Sachin Yadav,camera,1.0,11,8,2021,1,2,"Dear Amazon,I have purchased Oneplus Nord 2 last weeks. My mobile back camera has dust inside it. It seems like a manufacturing defects. I have also compared my device with others one. Kindly resolve my issue."
823,Balasubramani R,Worth buying & good smart phone,4.0,1,10,2021,1,1,Battery life stands for 1 full day with moderate usageCharges in 40 minsCamera quality is goodOverall performance is good
824,Siddhesh Mohan Patil,Average Phone,3.0,21,8,2021,1,0,This is an average mobile phone like other android phones. Call recorder system is the worst. When call recording is ON another person gets notification on the same call. Hence 3rd party application is required for call recording. Camera lenses are also average. Photos gets enhanced after clicking but clearly go away when you save those photos. Provided plastic case is low quality. Sometimes phone gets hanged due to downloading some application.Not recommend for all. Search for another phone in same price range.
825,Pankaj,Super phone I must say🥰 just loved it. An update to Nord is exactly what we needed🤗,5.0,6,8,2021,1,1,"After using it for a week, I likes it's camera which is really nice. Front camera require some improvement but still works fine. It has an amazing charging speed, 66 watt charger is the real killer. Amazing backup. Just loved it🥰. Worth every single penny. An all-rounder in this price segment.🤗"
826,Praveen,Do not buy,1.0,27,10,2021,1,1,It behaves like iron box instead of mobile phone.Battery is draining out in 5hrs.If you have an egg u can easily burn an omlet on it .Not all major cities of A.P are having service centers.Better you check for the nearest service center then choose this product if you are ok with mobile heat like iron box.I really mean it.
827,Dushyant,Works as advertised,4.0,15,8,2021,1,1,"Overall the phone works exactly as advertised..but battery could have been bigger..no doubt the battery gets fully charged from 0-100 in just 30 mints max..but it drains quicker, even if you are not a gamer"
828,Rajeesh km,Nothing,3.0,22,8,2021,1,4,Performance is not reach expectation level
829,Mohammed Hanif,The Best Smartphone in the 30k price segment!,5.0,20,9,2021,1,0,"This is the best smartphone ever in the 30k price segment,an amazing performance despite a new chipset of Dimensity 1200,which gives and equivalent performance of Snapdragon 870.Talking about the camera,it acquires it's Sony's lenses and aperture,which enhances every picture,giving it a really amazing colour touch and vibrancy.The 90Hz refresh rate is incredibly smooth,it becomes very easy to use.Then,the obvious User-Interface of OnePlus,the OxygenOS,is one of the most cleanest of UI's in today's smartphone generation.A huge thumbs up to OnePlus for launching an amazing phone at this price segment."
830,Altaf,The return of OnePlus as the flagship killer!,5.0,1,8,2021,1,1,"Flagship grade processor (Mediatek dimensity 1200 handles everything you throw at it with ease), Great display (The 90hz AMOLED display produces truly vibrant colours), impeccable cameras (Sony IMX 766 and the overall tuning hits it out of the park be it outdoor or low light conditions) & incredibly fast charging (65 watt warp charger is super quick)."
