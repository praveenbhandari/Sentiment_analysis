 It’s A average product decent for day to day activity.. one the thing I would like to mention that exchange was Far Far alot Good On amazon it was like 2 to 3 minutes and delivery agent was very Good with me although I had 2 scratches on it but he neglected it as it was minor scratches and I exchanged poco m2 pro 6 64gb variant which was exchanged for rupees 10100. I bought it at 12499 1 and Half year ago and sold it at at very good price!! So plus point To amazonComing Back to device I would say it’s a ok device camera is average performance is Fine one plus is losing it’s originality oxygen os to color or..WARP CHARGER TO VOOC CHARGER!! yes it has been taken by oppo!! I wish the way we believed in one plus doesn’t change with it as A one plus Fan We don’t want To merge with Other brands please keep your Originality Maintained!! thanx amazon for such a hasselfree exchange alot better than FLIPKART"

 Phone is is Fab!But sometime apps like Gaana, LinkedIn, etc are crashing, I think need to fix some bugs from OnePlus end.However, camera is good, finishing quality is good, sound effect could be better(not that load as compared to iPhone or other Mi phones)Touch is awesome, finger print sensor works too fast, excellent face detection unlockMost sexiest thing is charging, it charges way too quickly, 35-40min approx for full chageMany more extra features from Android Oxygen & One plus!!Phone is handy & a good buy in this range!"
7,Rajnish Dhull,Something is missing,3.0,26,2,2022,1,74,"Cons-1. Some apps, settings are like color os2. Shot on one plus - daily wallpaper feature is not there3. Weight not well balanced- felt heavier on the edges4. No alert slider5. Screen brightness is not that good ( problem when outside )Pros-1. 65W charging2. External microphone is working with 3.5 mm jack ( previously not supported even with different converters/cables )3. Good looks4. Provided case is also good for protection and looks ok5. Looks are goodNot sure-1. How this mediatek will perform in the long run2. How good the updates going to beIn my previous One Plus ( Nord 2020 ) there were some bugs introduced with each and every update. And one week before the launch of this Nord CE 2, my previous phone had- freezing,lag, hanging issues ( may be some dirty business strategy )"
8,Sachin Panwar,amazing,5.0,25,2,2022,1,57,Very amazingly built & decently featured smartphone...Battery last full day with proper usage & charges really fastVery smooth & accurate fingerprint scannerCamera is decent as per price...Loved it
9,Akanksha,Read,1.0,26,2,2022,1,111,I got my delivery on 23 feb when I unboxed the phone the display was damaged. I requested for replacement of my new phone so technician was suppose to come for inspection but instead of a visit he just talked on call and asked me to install an application. He did not even saw the damage of my display screen.Lets hope amazon does it right replace my phone. Will update the rest later.But amazon pls consider my request and replace the item as soon as possibleEdit- The phone is perfect... They replaced it and now everything is perfect...Camera quality is as expected very perfectOverall performance bestYou can go for it
10,Jaideep Chauhan,Good overall performance,4.0,25,2,2022,1,45,Bought this for my mother on the day of the launch. Lightweight and slim phone. Good look and specifications. The refresh rate is amazing given the cost. Satisfied with the product so far.
11,Anantha Krishnan,A good choice for upgrade,5.0,27,2,2022,1,54,"Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:Pros:- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed- Smooth performance and display- Comparatively compact and light weight- ""Unofficial"" water resistance (read below)- Design and color is neatCons:- Speaker isn't great- Camera is okayish- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of nowDetailed:- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can't be uninstalled). Didn't find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo's ColorOS.- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven't noticed any heating afterwards.- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be ""unofficial"" water resistance.- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven't tested much low light or night photography.- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).Overall it's a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones."
12,Haritha gidigi,****VERY DISPOINTED BY 1PLUS****. Sound and back camera poor quality.,1.0,28,2,2022,1,54,"****Don't buy any phones from Amazon*** i really had a bad exp. DISLIKE:For 25k poor build quality. Same configuration in real me etc are coming less than 18k only. Just for 1+ brand don't buy for 25k.---> Audio is worst, single speaker but volume too low in calls for other end. I think phone mic issues.----> Back camera not good---> phone touch also I felt bit lack.Like:--------+Fast charging, within 30min 100% charge .Front cam bit okay.Battery backup is good.8 5g bands. Support, dual 4g standby.**** If OnePlus can promise if they can do something on back camera quality and Audio improvements with updates buy it with any offers. Otherwise go for real me gt master or 9pro or 9pro plus.  And moto mobiles also good. I was using moto for 6years for only good camera and sound i took this but those two only drawback for this phone rest all okay manageble. And no return policy only replacement."

15,RITESH,Mid ranger Flagship.,5.0,27,2,2022,1,31,I got this mobile for ₹ 16999 which was an awesome deal for me. I have rated this phone based on 5 rating points.Delivery- 5/5 was superfast and exchange took place with ease and got offer of extraa ₹3000 discount.Packaging- 5/5 Packaging was awesome by amazon and Oneplus packaging is clean and very good all the documents including Red Cable Membership card got 3 months extended warranty using this.Charging-5/5 65 watt charger is already provided in the box which phone supports very nice move not like other companies. Charging cable is of good quality and charger as well.Looks- 4.5/5 Aesthetic wise its premium with glass back and curved edges and metal frame. camera bump is not very much unusual and gives decent look to phone. Inbox provided cover is of very good quality and looks very good. It feels good to hold and not feel very bulky termed as slimmest oneplus phone. Lower chin is on big side could be a bit smaller.Connectivity-5/5 Total number of 5G band supported is 7 and the phone supports VOWIFI on both sim. It supports dual 5G which I feel is future proof. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome with earbuds. It also supports dual band wifi. Its has got triple slot.O.S-4/5 Only issues is that it runs on Android 11 out of the box but with latest android security update and future update promises. OS is very smooth no lags were found. Always on display is very good. Customization is top notch.Sensor-5/5 It has got all the sensors as required including step counter.Battery-5/5 Charging from 0-100 hardly takes time with in box charger. If AOD is on and little battery consumption is on higher side with 90hz screen. I feel its good with F-amoled display.Screen-5/5 Fell in love with it in display fingerprint scanner is very good and display is bright enough at this price point better than MI phones. Display is immersive. It supports HDR10+ and comes with corning gorilla glass 5.Camera-4/5 Back camera is good with natural light and though struggles in low light.Dark mode does a good job.4K video is supported at 30fps Selfie camera is good with lot of features. No OIS is provided in both the camera. But EIS present.Calling- Its very loud and clear and no issues found.Perfomance-5/5 taking pricing point into consideration its good mid ranger chipset works well with heavy games at medium setting and normal day to day operations are carried out without any lags.GB ram is enough for daily operation.My recommendation is that if you get this phone at ₹20K the its a very good deal without any single thought go for it. However if you are a gamer and want a phone below 20K then you can go for Infinix 5G. However If you want a good camera phone at same price point of this then go for Realme 9 PRO Plus without any thought as camera is excellent for still photos but you will have to compromise with display.
16,deepak,Amazing Phone,5.0,26,2,2022,1,34,"Best Operating system after iPhone so you and ur data is safe. Those who do all their banking transactions through mobile, understand it's need. Plus 3 years security update. That's really great thing.2. Camera is good enough. Sharp and zoom is really good. See attached photo taken from 5 th floor.3. AMOLED display is amazing. Difference noticed while watching movies on Netflix. It's super.4. No DTS however phone sound is quite loud. Can take calls on loudspeaker without any issue.5. No complaint in speed. I don't play games however tried and it did not disappoint me.6. No heating issue. Heats little bit while charging and it's obvious as it's 120 W, I believe. Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 yes warranty. Seems like company is preety sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that. Rest are not so important for me however phone did well on all areas.Best of luck Chinese company... Till the time India doesn't develop its own effective mobile, keep earning. We will catch you soon!!"
17,anju,A decent package for non gamers and everything thing is decent not the best out there,4.0,26,2,2022,1,31,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matterDisplay -  Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as wellPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usageSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos 😂 but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better ideaCamera -  Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent thingsBattery -  Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fastSpeakers -  6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristicCall quality - Rating 10 :  it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbledSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good"
18,Raghuveer Bhati,Disappoint with build quality and display,1.0,26,2,2022,1,26,Phone's display and camera not upto the mark what I've expected form oneplus it's a lower segment feel after paying 25k if i know this thing I'm gonna go with realme or mi or iq in under 16k i get same features very disappoint with display and camera quality
19,Enayat,Excellent all rounder!,5.0,27,2,2022,1,37,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The Grey mirror finish is really cool and the phone is smooth in day to day usage. Charging speed is very fast but i couldn't test 0 to 100. As an estimate it'll take 30-45 mins for a full charge (Will update after testing). Cameras are all good and in par with RM9pro+(I do have it) especially the front cam. Overall it's a very good phone in this price range."

 Major weak points that disappoint.No stereo speakers.No RAM expansion.Struggle in low light condition.Should have RAM expansion and camera quality should be improved with new update."
22,Suhit,Average Phone. So keep average expectations.,3.0,28,2,2022,1,14,"Writing the reviews after 3 days of UsageDesign: Phone's design is good looking and decent. The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone. If you're a user who wants decent performance and camera, then go for this phone.Will update my reviews ad and when I keep using this phone and find anything."

MAJOR problem- It has google CALL RECORDER by default.. If you record during call ""it will prompt recording has started"" which can be heard to both caller and receiver.. I mean people use Call recorder for safety and secure purpose, but here it is opposite5. If you turn on WiFi hotspot for more than 10 15 minutes,it will start showing heating issue6.

35,Amaan,Great Cell,5.0,26,2,2022,1,6,"Each and everything about this phone is surprising what was truly more than expected was the charging I literall placed on charge at 9:00 @ 18% battery and after my breakfast @ 9:17 it was 81%, I was shocked and that lasted an ample amount of time in office, have left taking charger to office. Also the night charging is great the phone automatically optimises how fast to charge the mobile so that it reaches 100% at 6 in the morning.Happy till now with the purchase.Though there is a downside I hated the google phone and contact app I am badly missing the stock OnePlus apps, this is OnePlus not some android phone please don't use third party apps just be yourself you are gr8."

38,Shahid,Looks good so far,5.0,27,2,2022,1,6,Using since 2 days. No hanging issue faced so far and works absolutely smooth (I am not a gamer) . Camera might not be best in this class but still good. Macro camera just average. No bloatware. Almost Pure Android experience. Perfect crisp Display. I find it value for money at this price range.The case provided is of very inferior quality. Start turning yellow at the edges on the very first day. Better they would not have even provided this.PS: Will update my review in case I face any issue.
39,Mo On,"Not for any audiophile, USB audio is buggy",2.0,4,3,2022,1,7,"The USB audio in oneplus phone is merged with OTG, so each time you connect your external dac( fiio k9 pro, earman tramp, chord mojo) you need to switch on the OTG.But the bug start from there once any of this device disconnects you will need to restart you DAC again and again till it is by luck detected by the OnePlus phone again.In OnePlus forum the OnePlus team seems to be proud of this ""feature"" but as a developer I do not understand why they merged the USB audio with OTG.Over all this is not the phone for any one who use USB audio regularly. Irony is oneplus stoped adding audio jacks to their phone and promoted the wireless accesories.In the end it's all about marketing and business.Never going to buy any OnePlus brand devices anymore."
40,Sumit,Serving the purpose,4.0,5,3,2022,1,7,"Honestly speaking Phone doesn't meet OnePlus standards but at this price it's worth it. Grey color is top notch. It's amazingly gorgeous but never ever use it without cover.- Camera is fair performer.- Screen is fantastic.- OS has bugs but can be fixed in future updates.- Sound is acceptable.- Finger print reader is quite fast.- Dual Sim + Expandable memory is cherry on top.- 65W charger is life saver.- Phone heat up a bit while charging but it's negligible.- Almost no bloatwares.Far better than Redmi, Mi and Moto G competitors."

That phone is still with me working fine. I am a true one plus fan. So my review on this phone is that it very basic.To be honest I am disappointed with the phone. I agree it's a low and budget phone but still had better expectations.Pros: great feel in hand looks premium, Great battery and charging is like awesome. Sound is loud and brightness is also good. Videos look awesome. Touch is great, processor is 👌🏻Cons: not a gaming phone you'll be disappointed with that. Camera isn't that good at all. Body is plastic, speaker location makes it not audible with texting. Video get stuck and security and update patch is still not given.If you want to buy a phone for good use and want to use it for a long time. This is okay. But this is no where near to high gaming or photo fan phone"

The camera does so good ' the rear camera  has an auto HDR glitch  which i have to turn off everysingle time ! The selfie camera is just fantastic! My device doesn't lag not even a bit' and the features it has everything everysingle features for which OnePlus is known for but yea it misses the alert slider . The screen is well lit iand  the software UI it's an add-on to the beautiful screen .I get good ok network speed on this one . I had a hard time on my past device ...This device is really worth purchase

So once you will syn with Google contacts, you will see email id as well in your contact.• Initial phone comes with Back cover, but that is not too much fruitful."
60,Amazon Customer,Worst phone ever.,1.0,5,3,2022,1,3,This phone is not really stand in the line of oneplus series. The hardware quality is been hardly severely compromise. Phone hangs a lot from the very first day. While on call the sound quality is not so good. Phone is extremely slow. Picture quality taken by the cameras is quite pixelate despite of all the settings. Overall we have regretted buying this phone.
61,vivek kumar pandey,Worth the mid range.average performance of camera and phone.,4.0,28,2,2022,1,0,I got my product delivered on 27/02/2022..since im using honor 10..flagship..kirin 970 chipset phone the performance of dimesity 900 doesnt seemed fast ...but performance is good as a mid ranger...camera is good and one can get the same performance in 12 to 14 k phone having 50 MP sensor or above..i liked the display.. phone sound is enough...firmware is oxygen os based on android 11...front and back both cameras are worth the range..fingerprint..face scan sensors are responsive..looks are subjective..but plastic back panel is giving cheap apperance..phone is a good mid ranger but priced a bit higher...
62,Tushar Shete,Best budget phone at this price!!!!,5.0,14,3,2022,1,2,"This review is after 3 weeks of use of Oneplus nord ce2 5g (8gb 128gb)1. Pros- Display is good and gets quite bright in outdoors due to its claimed 800 nits brightness.- Supports upto 8 5G bands. Has wifi 6, bluetooth 5.2, nfc, dual 4G sims with expandable storage.- Mediatek dimensity 900 by no means is an efficienct chip and is a power hogger. But it packs a punch for day to day use. No lag and stutters. Snapdragon SOC fans might want to avoid this phone- Calls are clear and loud. Stereo speaker is single and is decent.- Screen refresh rate of 90hz is sufficient and the general use at 90hz feels smooth and fluid.- Under display fingerpriny reader is accurate and never misreads.2. Cons- Camera is decent and requires daylight to take crisp and crystal clear photos.- Battery life is 1 day for heavy users and is 2 days for light users. I got 8hrs of SOT with medium to heavy use. Mind that it was always on 90hz mode.Overall package is good and i'm totally satisfied with it."

FOR ME THATS THE AREA OF CONCERN.CAN #AMAZONE @ONEPLUS TEAM HELP ME OUT IF THIS???"
68,Tushar Ojha,Average mobile phone. DOES NOT justify it's price.,3.0,11,3,2022,1,2,1. Camera quality is just average like 15-19K mobile phone. Doesn't seems like this is oneplus mobile phone camera. I have upgraded from Redmi Note 10 and felt very little improvement in camera.2. Performance is also just okay. I have used oneplus nord 2 which is just 4K expensive than Nord CE 2 but way more faster than this.3. Battery life is great. Charging time is same as mentioned.Overall it is just an okay phone. Nothing special. 4-5K expensive than what is actually offered hence it is overpriced or doesn't justify it's price.
69,Prapul,Don't buy this shit,1.0,3,3,2022,1,3,ProsGood displayDecent built designFast biometricConsBattery drains fastCamera is like 2MPNo video stabilizationNight videos are very hard to visible because of amoled displayMy experience is totally worst with OnePlus Nord CE 2
70,P.k. saha,"It's a decent phone in its class , more likely a non OnePlus in OnePlus shell",4.0,8,3,2022,1,0,"It's a decent phone in its class but you get better options in same price in the market . The wide angel camera is not that good. No zoom option in 64 mp camera mode. Didn't like the slow-motion video . Macro shot is not great to work with . Battery drains quite quickly in normal usage in a day. Speaker sound is not that good. Display lacks vivid colours as the Samsung display is way better in 15k budget phones if you ask me .Pros.1: 3.5mm jack port that was missing previously2: currently the cheapest OnePlus. so , it's affordable.3: decent camera in the class but not the best."

72,deepak,Superb phone,2.0,1,3,2022,1,1,its a superb phone ..i had few problems in mine.. FRONT camera was the main problem ...its shows errors in some application too like G play...I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE REPLACEMENT BUT seller didn't let that happen .. so getting mine refund
73,Ankit,Not worthy at such a high price,3.0,7,3,2022,1,0,"The Phone is definatly good, but price is a bit high. no doubt its oneplus, and oneplus give a robust hardware which can run upto 3-4 years without any problem.My Criteria -5G - no need till 2023, let 5G network launch first.Charging/battery - 65w charger, best in segment.Proccessor - Mediatek, better if it was Snapdragon. (I compromise)Screen - Amoled.Camera - Not good (feels like I got scam)Features -Camera - camera is not good, it produce whitish pictures, Oneplus please update the software.Battery - Good, with fast chargingDesign - Its very handy phone with standard size.Processor - Its mediatek , better if it was snapdragonOverall - Camera is not good, may be in next software update camera will be fine.you can find better options in market. refer to the criteria above and make your decision."
74,Amazon Customer,It's a good value for money device by one plus.,5.0,8,3,2022,1,0,It's my first experience with one plus and has been good till now.  I am not a gamer. But for multimedia and casual photos the experience has been good. In hand field is good and software experience is nice without any bloatware. The Bahamas blue colour is exotic. Well optimised Ram management. Single speaker but is of good quality. Earpiece is loud and clear. Signal quality is good. Carrier aggregation is working fine. Haptic motor is good. Charger is simply amazing. 30 mins full charge. You can go for it provided you are not a hardcore gamer.
75,Sushant,Wasted!!!,1.0,7,3,2022,1,4,Camera is not good at all. Alot of bugs browser does not seem to be functioning correctly.Touch is too sentitive. Does not look like 64 mexapixel photo battery back up not good.. does not charge in 30 mins .it takes more than an hour. Camera looks awful it's too big .To sum it up I have wasted my money
76,Vikas J.,A good phone to buy,4.0,3,3,2022,1,0,"I have used it for more than a day and based on that, I am writing this review. The phone looks premium. I bought two of them and both the colours (Grey and Blue) are beautiful. It's a lightweight phone that gives a nice feel in hands. Comes with a transparent back cover that fits quite well. Camera quality is good but it should be improved with upcoming updates. I haven't checked 20x zoom yet. User interface is interesting but users like me need some time to become familiar with it. Charger definitely is faster than the supercars. It charges from 10 to 100 percent in 25-30 mins only without heating up. But the problem is the battery life. Without any high uses, it drained so fast. OnePlus must resolve this issue with upcoming updates. I am a moderate gamer and the phone doesn't hang at all, nor I experienced any heating issue. Touch is really smooth and the screen/display colours etc looks really wonderful (I am not a professional so can't write using professional jargons). Fingerprint sensor is fast enough and the animation associated with it looks beautiful. Overall it seems a nice phone to buy.May update the review after using it for a longer period."

Very easy to carry with lighter weight. Go for it guys."
80,Ravi,Good decent buy!!!,4.0,8,3,2022,1,0,"I bought this phone on the 1st day of launch without knowing what I am going to get from it. But after receiving the phone, I'm quite happy. The phone is fast, light & good in performance. The only drawback for me is that the battery charger doesn't holdup well. For someone who uses the phone only for work & internet, I have to charge twice daily. But it does charge in 15 mins! It's a good buy though!"

83,Aniket Patel,Flagship phone under 25K 😍,5.0,6,3,2022,1,0,"Everything is good on this phone 😊😍In hand feel is Awesome, Premium looks !!!Fingerprint sensor(3/5) is Very Good. But if you use Tempered glass you will feel a nanosecond lag.AMOLED display(5/5) is amazing and auto-brightness is working fine.Charging(5/5) is just to the next level, 100% charge in 20-25 minutes.Speaker(4/5) is Good, but dual Dolby speakers could be given at this prize.Processor is great, Oxygen OS is running smoothly with android 11 but 12 is needed.Camera is good but could be better at this price.WhatsApp is taking too much storage because it is storing the images and videos in their maximum quality which is not required. In my previous phone, the images were stored in 100-400 kb, but one plus is taking 1.4 - 2 MB for a single image which is toooo much."
84,ganesh jadhav,Why it is called as trusted brand. Not up to the mark. Don't buy.,2.0,9,3,2022,1,0,"As it is said to be trusted brand.I don't feel it really.Small small features are missing. Speed dial is not there which is available in nokia 1100 phone also. This is one example.I was POCO F1 user for 3 years. Not single time it got hanged. But this phone hanged 3 times in last 10 days. Black colour display come for 1 minute.Camera of POCO is 12 MP and this is 64 MP. STILL poco is best in zooming quality. Only point that camera captures colour in superb way than poco.Finger sensor is slower , unlock is slowerOnly point for me is good in this phone is fast charging which I don't know how many month of years remain same.And 2nd is dedicated slot for memoryThanks but don't go for this phone."

Vivo is just making us fool by promoting same configuration with one plus."
87,Mayur Patil,Value for money,4.0,1,3,2022,1,1,"Pros:1. One plus mobile in range of 25k2. Resolved some bugs that was in Nord 2.3. Sound is good and much loud.4. Charging is fast, just need 25-30 mins for 0-100%5. Display is much bright and full HD.6. Dedicated Sim Slot to extend ROM7. Performance is smooth even heavy games and applications is installed.Cons:1. Camera is not that good as expected from ONE+ , photos in dark are good but not satisfied. If we zoom images, pixels get scattered and image quality falls.2. Screen Lock fingerprint sometimes does not recognize quickly and shows wrong finger error.3. Android OS is still 11, It should be current OS."

Just the branding is OnePlus, the inside of the phone logically speaking is OppoMight wanna go for other options if you want the best. OnePlus lovers are excluded from my previous comment but keep in mind, it's just 5% OnePlus and not more.Goodluck"

From flagship brand.Even there are a lot of smartphones available in this segment but OnePlus stand's unique and Worthy one. OS was so good compared to Samsung one UI and Oppo colour os. More features available in oxygen OS. Importantly very light wieght to use... With 65 watt fast charging n 4500mah battery (not bad). Specs are good from big brand. Every smartphones has cons... This ph. Tooo...! But for day to day usage n works, more apps, streaming its really good. If someone like to buy smartphone from OnePlus in lower budget n then this is perfect one for u."
1021,Arpit,True OnePlus,5.0,4,3,2022,0,0,People have complained abou this being a rebadged Oppo phone but OnePlus have been doing this since OnePlus 1. Oneplus devices are more about experiance then just the specification and I am glad to report that the experience is still True OnePlus . The software is still fast and smooth and have that OnePlus character and the overall experience is far above the Oppo Vivi or Mi. Buy it for the experience of the best the Android has to offer. Fast smooth feature rich no bloatware and no ads atleast as of now even in future OnePlus has promised that they will be bloatware and ads free..

Touch and display is supreme battery last for about 1 day front camera is excellent rear cam is below par when compared to all other one plus phones and other brand phones of this segment.... performance for day to day life is excellent 65w super vooc charger charges your phone within 35-37 minutes ...final verdict :- if u need a branded device with little camera interest for a day to day usage u could go for it... without a doubt"

Also microphones are also not working.Adding to above, I started using the phone nowdays as a hot pack to relieve my pains. A good relief for me. thanks to One plus for the multipurpose.

Camera is better than other phones of this range. Display is smooth and processor is as expected by one plus. I have previously used one plus 3T for 4 years. Definitely the quality of one plus phones is still up to mark. The only thing I didn't like is mirror back of phone as now a days better looking phones are available.

1458,Chanakya Umesh,I don't see anything wrong with it. It's just a good phone. Delivery was shite though!,5.0,6,4,2022,1,0,"This was my first phone above 20k, and tbh, it's not bad. I'm not much of a phone user, except calls and messaging sometimes. And maybe stream some media and spotify mostly. But on average I register about 3-4 hours of use daily, so the battery life lasts me about a day and a half. Plus this is my first fast charging experience, so I'm happy with that. about 30 mins from 20% to a 100%. Not bad at all. Camera is good too. I won't use it much, but it's a nice feature regardless. everything works quite smooth and overall, a decent phone and quite sturdy too. Build quality is pretty damn good. My only gripe was the delivery. My first order apparently got misplaced by the incompetency of the delivery team. It roamed in my city for 4 days, and after a heated call with customer service, it was replaced with a new order immediately after. So no harm no foul!  Overall I'd give it 4.5 stars. It gets the job done fast, and comes with a boatload of features too."

I should have gone for an Oppo newer model as replacement but wanted to try this.15 days after my purchase,  the phone fell down from a high table, maybe about 4-4.5 feet high and the screen broke.Now I have to shell another 8k to get it replaced. While at store, I met three other people who had come for screen replacement too as theirs also broke.  One guy was coming to get it replaced 2nd time.If you do however plan to purchase the phone,  go for a wallet style cover, because I dont think this phone can take any other type of case.My phone was in an open case provided by ONE PLUS and screen was covered with gorilla glass.My oppo falls down on an average 2-3 times a day,  and have had no issues in the past 3 years.... Except for the fact that the memory has become too less for me to accomodate all the apps,  I would have stuck to my oppo.Overall for a brand like ONE PLUS,  I expected better.😞 DISAPPOINTED!!!PROS : The fast charger is really awesome.  30 mins charges it to full. Thats the only feature I love about it."

This is very light and compact phone made by plastic back and frame.Display : 90 Hz is a sweet spot. Feels smooth and good on battery as well.Performance : Processor is doing more than good for day to day tasks. I don't play games so I can't comment on it.Battery : 4500MAH is decent power. It can last a day. 65W charger is amazing charges battery in 35 mins.Os : It's still clean Oxygen os on top of Color os. They should have given Android 12 out of the box.Camera : Missing OIS but not so many phone come in this price range with it. It clicks decent photos and videos in good lighting but struggles a lot in poor light conditions.Cons : I feel they should have provided stereo speakers, iconic alert slider, OIS in main camera and Android 12 out of box."

The software UI was very glitchy and had bugs but after a few updates it was working fine.  But one day my phone got a little wet and that was the end of it (for reference imagine it was raining and a few drops fell on you before you got under a roof and your phone was in your pocker) those few drops of water absolutely wrecked its motherboard and the camera and the touch. When I went to claim the warranty they said it would cost double the phone's mrp in order to fix it enough to work???? Would never have expected this from one plus.

2172,Dhruv Raman,The OnePlus Experience.,5.0,10,4,2022,1,0,"OnePlus kinda pulled this one out by a miracle.So the reason for this statement is because it feels too good to be true on the surface and if you are someone like me then there's a high chance you have watched every review of this phone already so lets see what we find :The build is like a Flagship, no issues and really well built feel in-hand. retains the audio jack on the sacrifice of the mute switch on the side but personally not a very big thing in usage at all. single speaker but loud like real loud. Type C with fast charging that charges the phone upto 70 in the first 20 mins then another 10-15 mins to reach 100 (that's like real fast for a charger guys). OS is the best side of this, default oxygen os with enough customization and do note that i was a Nova Launcher user so having an stock launcher that too on my daily driver means this thing rocks! . Performance is really good, easily beats any competition out there, no heating issues or battery drain issues or lag, had the best BGMI experience yet (Smooth+Extreme with constant 60FPS) thats really good and also good enough for any game you plan to play on the device. Cameras are a mix of the camera you would expect with a little more and for the price range they are great :)overall if you ask me (i got this phone for 17k) its a really great phone and you should just go with it, the best phone in the budget segment Period."

At the time of exchange, delivery agent was ready to accept the exchange mobile phone. I logged in amazon app , proceeded for exchange verification but at the step of entering verification code, there was a message of updating latest version of app. After that I downloaded latest version of app but problem was not solved . Contacted several times to customer care several times in presence of delivery agent to help. Sometimes call got disconnected? Sometimes received answer to update the app which I already done. There was no  proper technical support but customer care executive insisting on cancel order in stead providing technical support. Finally I had to cancel order due to poor customer care support. Amazon's customer care really does not care about their customers. They don't want to give exchange deals in spite of good working phone. Just harass customers by the declaring lucrative exchange offers. Amazon technical support need improvement."

Figer print option is disappearing sometimes. Battery is also not upto the mark.Over all I lost impression on one plus and regretting my purchase. Other than fast charging I didn't see anything good in this phone. At this price range there are other mobiles providing better cam quality with better performance.Expected something better from one plus, completely disappointed 😞"

2271,Pandit salekar,Should be better,1.0,24,4,2022,1,0,Battery life of the Nord is not better it's finishes in just 30-40min how we should work on that. OnePlus has given a superfast charger 65w for what the battery life of the phone should be more like 5-6000mah. Camera is also good not better. Fingerprint is not so fast.

2440,Zaheer M K,Overall nice phone,4.0,22,4,2022,1,0,"Battery life is good, easily lasts a day for my usage, with frequent chat updates, some music playing, once or twice camera usage etc.Display quality, photo quality, sound quality are all above average.However, a bug that disappointed me is that the fingerprint sensor doesn't turn on even in always on display mode. And the bug is so bad, that almost always, the power button has to be pressed for unlocking the phone and at times even then, the fingerprint sensor doesn't give prompt and so the pin has to be entered. Pathetic, I'd say.Worse still is, as understood from the OnePlus community website, the bug is known to the developers, but they've been unable to bring an resolution to this issue till now."
