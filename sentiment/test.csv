1,Anil,No Charger For Uneducated Public,1.0,27,9,2021,0,751,Its really Shocking that there is no chager which is totally a scam with the customers by Apple they think Indians are Fool and some Indians  are really doing foolish by purchasing this Iphone without charger...don't buy Iphone until they  provide charger total boycott this Iphone...
2,Vempati Harish Chakravarthi,Got it very quick,5.0,26,9,2021,1,116,"There are a bunch of reviews on the product already. Just sharing my 1st day experience so far, I loved it. This is a major upgrade for me, I jumped from iPhone 7 to 13mini after 4 years. Always wanted to smaller iPhone and looks like so far 13mini is by far the best predecessor of iPhone 7( for me interns of size vs performance ratio). Fantastic Camera, better battery life, and incredibly light phone. All the faults from iPhone 12mini are addressed in this phone. This will be a model which I can hold for at-least next three years in my opinion."
3,Jofert,Simple & Sample,5.0,25,9,2021,0,149,"Like iphone 11,12 now 13. All same look and minor differences. Why Apple fellows release phone with no new features"
4,Brajesh Bharti,Don't opt it :( 12 Pro is better option,1.0,26,9,2021,0,71,"I would suggest 12 Pro over 13 mini. Just a suggestion, I regret now and don't want you to fall for this trick of 13. Hard earned money should be well used. I don't see much difference between 12 Pro and 13 Mini with respect to Software and Hardware Upgrade, but we can see a high spike in cost of 13 Series.Suggestion to Apple, it would be far better to grow Real Apple then to sell out such a product to Consumers. I trust Apple would think over my suggestion and bring out some idea to grow Real Apple. Thanks in advance APPLE."
5,Joshuaa Anand,Not worth an UPGRADE,1.0,26,9,2021,0,65,"Writing from 'iPhone xs max' I dint see a REAL WORLD improvement to upgrade from my phone till date. Its all about the extra camera and the camera placement. I am still in a Three year old phone which works smooth as butter, which no android does.Sticking to iPhone only for the OS"
6,Vish,Not practically Useful. Just an extra product by apple,1.0,26,9,2021,0,52,Mini series is not practically useful at its price point. Seems it was just brought to fill the price in that bracket and launch a costlier 12 version. Apple should rather had skipped this and launched 12 at its price. Doesn't provide value for money.
7,Nitin Verma,Go for Samsung / Oneplus,1.0,26,9,2021,0,49,Same as previous model iPhone 12 with smaller notch. Don't understand why price is high .Waste of money .
8,Varun kasala,Review,1.0,26,9,2021,0,44,It’s not a good phone. Buy iPhone 13 pro max. Better phones are still available in the market like androids
9,Arvind,Useless upgrade,1.0,28,9,2021,0,24,Apple’s another generation phone with nothing new. Repeating the same set of features for last 3 years. Honestly Apple’s downfall has started. Their business is coming to an end soon. They could have waited for another year for new release. Iphone 13 series was not needed at at ll.
10,Ravi kumar,Overpriced,1.0,28,9,2021,0,25,"Unworthy and overpriced, worthless upgrade... I can't even get more zoom option in camera, better to stick to 11 or 12"
