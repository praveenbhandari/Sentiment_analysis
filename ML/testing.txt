Hi All. I have purchased OP Nord 2 for upgrade from my two years old Realme X. But my experience with Nord 2 is very bad. first its display is very bad quality compare to smartphone at 30k range. Even my Realme x display looking good against Nord 2. Its major highlight camera also very poor quality nowhere near to flagship sensor as OP advertising. Daylight pics are pathetic. After system update App Clone function is not working not able to use my 2nd whats app account. Call Recording function is not working which is my main requirement that is working flawless in my realme x. I think OnePlus make fool of us. Everyone who is purchasing will regret afterwards. So beware of OP Nord 2.
Not satisfied with the phone, heating issues, hanging. Tried replacing the phone but same issues with that piece also. So returned the phone. It has been almost 20 days, I am waiting for refund, customer care does not care. Every time they say the refund will be done in 3 to 5 days. And I wait and call them again and again. Very very very bad from Amazon and I am a dissatisfied customer. Will never buy any mobile from Amazon.
Pathetic performance. Major heating issue, no support from oneplus..Have provided all debug report, necessary inputs to analyse the issue, not support from oneplus. Refer attached response after 1month followup.I have debugged by my own. Issues mainly in:1. GPU performance compatibility with processor.2. Over locked cpu caused over consumption of battery while using camera, videocall or net browse. Causing heating issue3. Lagging of power consumption optimization and 65w charger causes heat during chargeIf you still interested, after performing os update, go to advance settings and adjust refresh ratio to 90 hz and reduce GPU cycle. Switch off GPU performance logging and all other back end performance reporting logs. This actually may help you reducing the heating issue. But that's just a temp fix. OnePlus has to take care the problem seriously.








Loved it, I am using the oneplus 8T I got this phone for my girlfriend and even though I spent like 13k extra when I got 8T I don't feel like the difference between both the phones are worth 13k. I am loving this phone.Pros:Fast chargingSmooth usageLooks (this depends user to user)CameraCons: Should have put the 120hz display instead of 90hzInclusion of colorOS UI in camera and settings
What's not to love about this phone, i was a OnePlus 6 user since May 2018 and the phone was running fine but I just bought this phone on impulse by just seeing the specs and the price point.....and i am glad OnePlus didn't disappoint. Ordered it on 26th July and received it today , been using this phone for 3 hours and i am just loving it. People are comparing this phone with Poco F3 GT but let me tell u guys that the UI experience u will get with MIUI is nowhere close to Oxygen OS, not to mention better cameras. I am glad OnePlus is back to the flagship killer segment and not just flagships. No overheating issues as of now....and everything is on point. A big shout out to Amazon for superfast delivery.
Great for daily use.Good looking and comfy in hands.OS is greatCamera 5/5Battery 5/5Display 5/5 (except the refresh rate)Speaker and sound 5/5NFC - YesWifi Calling - YesFingerprint 5/5Face unlocking 5/5Heating issue - First two days, I was worried about it because of the heating of both phone and adaptor only while charing but later on, it was fine. Haven't experienced any heating issue while using the phone. Since it's 65W charging you must expect some heating while charging which is normalThe main drawback - 120Hz refresh rate is not available at this price rate.
I have purchased this mobile in a month ago and every thing ok,now I am facing an issue with battery in the starting days the mobile charging is excellent when I was used all most all social media apps,but now when I keep the charging in the morning it's was down to 30 to 20 % in the same day I called to the cc and explained my problem they initially told some settings and off the mobile and run in safe mode every thing was done but there is no much difference ni found and the cc team saying which app will consume more charging they were asking and the initial days on wards I m using the same apps but that time I haven't faced any Charing down issue after using one month I m facing this issue..I was dispoined..from one plus ..This is the review I have writing after one month usage of mobile
Overall the phone is quite outstanding.Camera is amazing (but that OnePlus camera app missing , you get a color os camera app which is just ok)Battery is satisfactory. For me it lasts about 18 19 hrs (which includes around 1 hr of gaming playing call of duty and vlash of clan)with a screen on time of 5-6 hrs which is decent.Charging is mesmerizing ðŸ¤©. 0 to 100 in 31mins. This is the best part of this phone. Drain it as much as you can and charge it for just 15 min you will get enough to sustain 5 6 hrsCall quality is good with proximity sensor properly workingStereo speakers will amaze you. Best i would say in this price.Screen experience vould have been even better we get 120 hz display but 90hz is ok.
I don't why the youtube community discourage this phone but it's now a month I have been using this phone and is the best ever device in 2021. Please don't hesitate, don't keep any second thoughts just go for it. One plus is one plus and not just ant brand out there and thanks to Amazon for providing me huge discount offer I got this product some what near 20ishhh. And I am delighted about it..
